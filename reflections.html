									<h1>Launching into<br />
									Computer Science</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								</p>
								<h2>Unit 1: Computing as a Profession - Responsibilities and Challenges</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit</h3>
								<p>The main theme of the first unit was the computing as a profession and the challenges and threats involved in the modern world of advanced technology. Considerable amount of reading was focused on the ethics and regulations of several professional bodies such as IEEE or BCS. Another important topic was the threat posed on the privacy. Apparently, a lot of data about individuals is gathered on various venues (social media, health apps, etc.) without explicit consent and this leads to privacy issues. Even when the data is gathered with consent, problems occur when the data is processed extensively. In order to prevent such issues, some precautions and legislation like GDPR is put in place. Finally, we had the opportunity to gain a general understanding of cyber security, common threats (e.g. virus, worms, Trojan horse, etc.) and the measures to prevent them (e.g. antivirus software, firewall, etc.).</p>
								<p>We also had a chance to discuss the career path we would like to take, and the challenges attached to it. I read many interesting ideas from the fellow students, and especially the discussion about the AI caught my attention as this is a rising, and nevertheless, a controversial field. </p> 
								<p>In my opinion, this unit was more about informing the would-be computer scientists about the ethics of their future profession as well as the rules that they must adhere to. Since misconduct would lead to serious consequences, I think this was the right approach. After reading about the aforementioned topics, I feel more confident about ‘dos and don’ts’ of the computing professionals. Moreover, the information we had about the cybersecurity threats is very useful both for our daily lives as well as for our future profession.</p>
								<p>From this point onwards, having read about much of the rules and regulations about privacy, I will be more sceptical about personal data when working on user-facing projects. Furthermore, even though I already knew a lot about the types of cyber security threats, the chapter about cybersecurity helped me to cement my knowledge.</p>
								<p>All in all, this unit provided me with a fresh perspective which, I believe, will prove useful during my studies in coming weeks and months.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
                						<h3>Forum discussion: </h3>
								<p><i>What IT role would you like to assume and what kind of challenges are attached to the role you selected?</i></p>
                						<p>Personally, I am interested in the role of software developer, possibly not as a full-stack developer (Taivalsaari et al., 2021) but rather, a developer who is focused on a specific skill and working in a larger team.<br />
								I believe, among the main challenges for this role are:<br />
								- <b>Competence</b>: I need to have the necessary knowledge in a number of programming languages as well as some other tools which could come in handy in software development.<br />
								- <b>Self-learning</b>: I need to keep my competence up to date by constantly monitoring the latest developments in the field of Computer Science, be it a new programming language or a new concept, etc.<br />
								- <b>Teamwork</b>: Since I am more interested in working in a team in large projects rather than working alone, I need to display a positive attitude towards my colleagues and be able to work with them in harmony. This also includes helping my teammates to develop themselves and learning from them.<br />
								- <b>Ethics</b>: I must adhere to the code of ethics accepted widely by the industry (BCS, 2021).</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<p>- Types of cyber attacks include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, phishing, spam, denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS).<br />
								- Protection measures against the cyber attacks include firewalls, spam filters, proxy servers, antivirus software and various techniques called “cryptography” (encryption, certificates, authentication, digital signatures, etc.)<br />
								- There is a thin line between sharing one’s personal information on voluntary and involuntary basis.<br />
								- The data collected by the companies (sometimes with a small incentive like a discount) are very precious, but the innovative way to use them (such as identifying purchase patterns of customers and offering them a customized promotional campaigns) make it much more valuable.<br />
								- The most powerful way to avoid the database abuses is the public opinion. Legal punishments and fines might prove useful, but what most companies fear most is a negative public opinion against themselves.<br />
								- There are a lot of codes and rules published by national bodies or professional associations about how to handle the personal data as well as the ethics of IT professionals. While each of them is unique in the way they are structured or written, all of them converge towards a more responsible use of personal date, a greater care to privacy and an ethical way to practice the professions - which leads us to some globally accepted principles.</p>

								<h2>Unit 2: Introduction to Computer Architecture and the Functionality</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit</h3>
								<p>Unit 2 elaborates on what is going on under the hood once we turn on a computer. The reading covered everything from the basics like boolean operations and gates to more complex subjects like CPU architecture and Virtual Machines. The most interesting topics for me was how the flip-flows are used to “remember” a bit, the way the controllers are connected to the bus and compete over the use of bus, the evolution of storage systems and finally, the types and inner workings of the virtual machines. I was especially intrigued by the latter subject, since I have an experience with VMs as an end user, having used all three major operating systems (Windows, MacOS and Linux-based systems).</p>
								<p>In the Seminar 1 which we had this week, we had a chance to discuss these topics in a slightly different manner than shown on our core book with our tutor and it proved very useful. We put a special emphasis on the types of computers based on different criteria such as purpose, functionality, etc. In the end of the seminar, we were given some questions to answer in the forum. You can read my answers to the questions below.</p>
								<p>To summarize, I see unit 2 as the foundation of the computer architecture and how the OS/applications and the computer system interact with each other. It helped me to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and to develop a better understanding of the basis concepts of computer science.</p>								
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
                						<h3>My answer to the Seminar 1 questions: </h3>
								<p><i>The difference between registers and memory:</i></p>
                						<p>I will explain the difference between the registers and memory with a “kitchen metaphor”: Imagine a kitchen in which a mother is preparing a meal. There are the groceries (eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, etc.) on the table. The mother first takes the eggplants from the <b>table</b> and puts them to the <b>kitchen counter</b> and cuts it to small pieces. When she is done with it, she puts the small pieces to the saucepan and empties the <b>kitchen counter</b>. Then, she takes the tomatoes from the <b>table</b> and puts them to the <b>kitchen counter</b> and starts working on them. When she is done with it, she adds them to the saucepan too. </p>
								<p>Now, in this metaphor, the table is the memory – it is where we have all the data (the groceries) and the kitchen counter is the register (a temporary place where we process the data). If we extend our metaphor a little bit further, the <b>cellar</b> is the secondary memory (e.g. hard disk) which is not volatile and which accommodates all the groceries – even those that we are not interested in using them at that very moment.</p>
								<p>In a nutshell, the register is the temporary place where the CPU stores the data it fetches from the memory, for the arithmetic/logic unit to process it according to the instruction set given.</p>
								<p><i>The main functionalities of a CPU are (Brookshear & Brylow, 2020: chapter 2):</i><br />
								- To coordinate the activities of the computer via the control unit,<br />
								- To process the data according to the instruction set via the arithmetic/logic unit,<br />
								- To fetch the data as well as the instructions from the memory via bus and store the data temporarily in the registers for the arithmetic/logic unit to work on them,<br />
								- To send back (write) the data from the register to the memory,<br />
								- To follow the “machine cycle” which is a three-step procedure comprising of fetching, decoding and execution. </p>
								<p><i>Some examples of different types of computers:</i></p>
								<p>Computers based on purpose:<br />
								1. Micro Computers: Macbook Air, iPad<br />
								2. Mainframe Computers: Turkish National Health Tracking System (e-nabiz)<br />
								3. Super Computers: Deep Blue, JASMIN<br />
								4. Mini Computers: Turkish Airlines Online Check-in Booth</p>
								<p>Computers based on functionality:<br />
								1. Workstations: My iMac at home.<br />
								2. Servers: The server of the intranet system KaraNet (in English: LandNet) which is used by the Turkish Land Forces.<br />
								3. Embedded: The Multimedia Interface installed on my Audi car.</p>
								<p>Computers based on data handling type:<br />
								1. Analogue computers: Tachometer in my car.<br />
								2. Digital computers: A digital clock, a calculator or generally, a laptop.<br />
								3. Hybrid computers: ECG machines in the hospitals.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<p>- Babbage’s <b>Difference Engine</b> is one of the earliest ancestors of modern computers. The Difference Engine computes the square values of numbers using the successive differences.<br /> 
								- The result of a boolean operation (the most important of which are: OR, AND, NOT, XOR) are produced by gates (a.k.a. logic gates). A flip-flop is a circuit which is comprised of several gates and produces an output value of 0 or 1 and they remember the value (e.g. stay the same way) until they are changed by an outside stimuli.<br />
								- Hexadecimal notation helps us to simplify the representation of bit patterns. But, no matter which notation is used, machine only understands 0s and 1s. One hexadecimal symbol represents 4 bits.<br /> 
								- Main memory is made of flip-flows which are capable of storing one bit. It is made of addressable cells but it is very volatile and known as Random Access Memory (RAM).<br />
								- Mass storage systems are broken down into three categories: Magnetic systems (HDDs, magnetic tapes, floppy disks), Optical systems (CSs, DVDs, BDs) and Flash drives (SSDs, SD cards). <br />
								- Sign bit shows if the numerical value is negative or nonnegative.<br />
								- Data Compression techniques are fall into two categories: Lossless and lossy techniques.<br />
								- Ways to detects communication errors include parity bits and error-correcting codes. Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols of equal length (e.g. bit patterns of same length) are different.<br />
								- CPU is comprised of the <b>control unit</b>, the <b>arithmetic/logic unit</b> and <b>registers</b>. <br />
								- Two types of special registers: <b>Program counter</b> and <b>instruction register</b>.<br />
								- <b>Bus</b> connects CPU to main memory.<br />
								- The revolutionary finding was that the programs can be encoded in the memory just like the data. This approach is called “Stored-program Concept”. <br />
								- Two types of CPU architecture: (1) RISC: Reduced instruction set computer. (2) CISC: Complex instruction set computer.<br />
								- Categories of instructions: (1) Data transfer group. (2) Arithmetic/logic group. (3) Control group.<br />
								- Programs are executed following the Fetch - Decode - Execute cycle.<br />
								- Controllers use the same bus between the CPU and main memory so that they can ‘listen’ to the signals sent between the CPU and main memory. Controllers are given direct memory access (DMA).<br />
								- <b>Von Neumann bottleneck</b> happens when central bus become an impediment as CPU and controllers compete for bus access.<br />
								- DSL takes advantage of the frequencies above the audible range which is not used by the telephone lines.<br />
								- To increase the execution speed, alternative architectures such as pipelining or multiprocessor machines are used.<br />
								- Virtual machines helps to solve the problem caused by the diversity of architectures and operating systems, helping the end users to run applications on a system which normally not compatible with. <br />
								- <b>ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)</b> marks the division between hardware and software (User ISA and System ISA). <br />
								- <b>ABI (Application Binary Interface)</b> is comprised of user instructions and system calls. System call sends specific instructions to the machine according to the user instructions.<br />
								- <b>API (Application Programming Interface)</b> uses standart libraries to invoke services available on the system.<br />
								- Types of VMs: Process VMs (supports an ABI e.g. user instructions + system calls) and System VMs (supports a complete ISA, e.g. user instructions + system instructions).<br />
								- Multiprogramming: OSs run multiple processes at the same time, but this is not always visible in the first look. <br /></p>

								<h2>Unit 3: Emerging Trends in Computer Science</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit</h3>
								<p>In Unit 3, I have (re)discovered the latest trends in the world of computing. Even though I was quite knowledgable in topics like Cloud Computing, Artificial intelligence or Internet of Things as an “end user”, the in-depth reading included in this united help me to gain exhaustive information as a would-be IT professional, as well as to discover the threats that these emerging areas contain within themselves. The Network Fundamentals section of the lecture cast was especially full of useful and interesting information in topics like protocols or network devices, again, about which I had a general understanding already. For me, the artificial intelligence was the most important topic of the unit, because it is one are which have the potential to take the humanity to a whole new level and make our lives better and to pose a number of threats to our civilization. It is up to us (to IT professionals first, and then to all humanity in a broader sense) to use it in a clever way to make the best use of it while mitigating the risks.</p>
								<p>We had two research tasks in this unit: AI tools developed by Google and Google Translate. I was able to put the newly acquired knowledge in this unit to work and critically evaluate both tools. You can read my findings below.</p>
								<p>To conclude, the unit made me become aware of the inner workings of the network infrastructure as well as the current state of the latest trends and the potential future direction of the innovative technology. I strongly believe that this awareness will come in handy as I move forward in my studies to explore the technical side of things.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
                						<h3>Outcome of research activities: </h3>
								<p><i></i></p>
                						<p><b>AI tools developed by Google:</b> Google provides many AI tools for developers, enterprises and startups. While TensorFlow looks like (even though I do not have first-person experience with it) an impressive tool for developing AI-based tools, I think the most important tool here is the datasets offered. Even while designing a simple Excel sheet (for example, a personnel information system which would store the personal information of each person, keeps track of their leaves and also the payrolls) I personally needed a dataset to check if the system works properly. In the context of AI, these huge datasets may prove useful to conduct a supervised training. Other tools offered here like Cloud AI, Cloud AutoML ot Launchpad Studio helps the developers, entrepreneurs and startups to bring their projects to real life.</p> 
								<p><b>Google Translate:</b> Even though Google Translate has come a long way to provide far better solutions that it did a couple of years ago, it is still far from perfect. My observation with the tool is that when you type in a sentence, it translates the literally, taking the ‘literal meaning’ of each word and phrase which, in my opinion, sets a perfect example of syntactic analysis. But then, if you type in more sentences and add more context, the output gets better (contextual analysis). Here, I want to compare Google Translate with DeepL - another tool which I prefer to use. Even though DeepL offers a very limited selection of languages when compared to Google Translate, it performs better thanks to two factors: 1. It uses the data of the online dictionary Linguee which searches for an adds translations to its database and evaluate the translations by user feedback and a special algorithm. 2. It uses “Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)” as opposed to “Recurrent Neural Networks” used by Google Translate. CNN helps DeepL to come up with a more precise translation when provided with a longer text (with more context). I believe, Google Translate will keep improving as it it is provided more context and thus, have the opportunity to learn more. But I still think that they should have a team of linguists for each language (if they don’t have them already) to help it better mimic the human language, just like the supervised training concept envisions.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<p>- Two approaches in the AI: <b>Weak AI</b> suggests that the machines can be programmed to exhibit intelligence, whereas <b>Strong AI</b> suggests that it is possible for a machine to have intelligence and consciousness. 
								- Language Processing: It is not enough for a machine to successfully specify the parts of speech of a sentence (e.g. syntactic analysis), but it has to consider the context, the implications and other factors (e.g. semantic analysis, contextual analysis). In this sense, the human brain is still much more powerful than machines.<br />
								- A production system is comprised of three main components: (1) A collection of states. (2) A collection of productions. (3) A control system. <br /> 
								- <b>Heuristic</b> is a quantitative value which measures the distance between one course of action and the nearest goal. In other words, it is the ‘cost’ of the COA.<br />
								- <b>Machine learning</b> consists of several levels: Imitation (the machine imitates the human), Supervised training (the human teaches the machine the correct way of doing something), Reinforcement (machine judges itself on the outcome of its action. Unsupervised training proposes a training method with minimal human intervention (as opposed to the supervised training). <br />
								- While learning is target based (we know what to learn), discovery is not (we discover things by chance). Discovery relies heavily on reasoning based on heuristics. Intelligent applications need to distinguish meaningful results from meaningless ones. <br />
								- Evolutionary programming foresees a development system in which machine is fine-tuned over time (opposed to being hard-coded).<br />
								- Neural networks mimic the network of neurons in biological systems. A neuron gets input from other neurons (0s and 1s), calculates a value depending on the input and weights, compares it with the threshold value and depending on the outcome of this comparison, produces an output.<br />
								- A neural network is not programmed, instead, it is trained via supervised training (it learns the weight values by making small adjustments). <br />
								- Two important approaches to the robotics: (1) Robots keep a detailed record of its environment and acts accordingly. (2) Robots react to the ,immediate objects and actions in their surroundings (w.g. ‘reactive robots’). <br />
								- In the past, technology was slow enough for humans to digest. However, in today’s world, it develops at a much faster rate that it creates a lot of ethical questions and issues. Perhaps, today’s life is overdependent on the machines?<br /></p>

								<h2>Unit 4: Computing Infrastructure and Network</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit</h3>
								<p>As the name suggests, the focal point of the Unit 4 was the networks and network components. The core book represents all the information in a well-structured manner which starts from the fundamentals (e.g. the classifications of networks, topologies, protocols, network elements used to combine networks) to more complex topics (w.g. DNS lookup, internet addressing. Understanding the concept of the layered approach to internet software and client side/server side activities was the most important part of the unit for me. One deficit of the core book, in my opinion, is that DNS lookup process is not discussed throughly. If we had a diagram of how the DNS lookup is carried out (DNS Resolver root server, domain name server, etc.), it would help a lot. I had to make my own research to understand the subject better.</p>
								<p>The additional reading material was particularly interesting. The article about the “Connected Vehicles” proved very useful for me to see the real-life application of the topics discussed in this unit. The TED talk delivered by Avi Rubin was very interesting as it shows how the simple things are in fact small computers and therefore can be hacked in various ways.</p>
								<p>We also had a seminar (Seminar #2) this week, in which we discussed the concept of emerging technologies and the challenges they pose. </p>
								<p>--------</p>
                						<h3>Outcome of research activities: </h3>
								<p><i>1. Open a website on a browser then investigate various functionality that are associated with the browser to get a webpage loaded.</i></p>
                						<p>I did this activity in two steps to beter reflect the effect of the DNS cache: First, I tried to access a website which I use frequently (e.g. www.cumhuriyet.com.tr  - a newspaper I read regularly) and a website which I never visited before. I used Google Chrome browser for this investigation.</p>
								<p>When I typed in the URL of the website www.cumhuriyet.com.tr to the browser’s address line, it loads pretty quickly. That is because this is a website I visit frequently and I already have the DNS lookup information from my previous lookups (possibly from the first lookup) in the DNS cache on my machine. Therefore, my DNS lookup doesn’t need to be forwarded to the DNS resolver and then to the root server, TLS server and DNS server. Moreover, it is also important to note that, there is a padlock icon to the left side of the URL on the address line, meaning the “connection is secure”. This is because even though I did not explicitly typed https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr,  the browser used HTTPS protocol (the secure version of HTML protocol) because the domain was preconfigured to use HTTPS. Finally, when I looked up for the IP address of the www.cumhuriyet.com.tr domain URL (via https://www.whatismyip.com/dns-lookup/), I found out that the IP addresses of the URL are 104.26.15.176, 172.67.69.185 and 104.26.14.176.</p>
								<p>In the second part of my investigation, I typed in www.gratis.com - a website that I never visited. This time, it took slightly more time (because we are talking about milliseconds after all) until the domain name is resolved. Even though we can’t see anything on the browser UI, from what I learnt in this unit, I know that when I typed in the URL of the website, DNS lookup process is started. It went through the DNS Resolver to Root DNS server, then to the TLD Server (for .com) and finally, to the name server of gratis.com and then, the IP address of the domain name is sent to the machine through DNS Resolver. Then, the machine contacts the server using the IP address t received from the name server to fetch the data stored in the server and display it on the browser to the user. Likewise, when I looked up for it, I found that the IP addresses for gratis.com domain name are 23.34.82.137 and 23.34.82.149. Hopefully, next time (if) I visit the website, it will lake less time because the DNS lookup result (e.g. the IP address the domain name refers to) is saved in the cache.<br /></p>
								<p><i>2. Attempt to create a simple website using html by visiting the Introduction to HTML Codio module.</i></p>
                						<p>As per the activity instructions, I hace created a simple website on Codio IDE. My website specs are:</p>
								<p>- It has a home page and two inner pages (Biography and Works of Dvorak). <br />
								- It has a simple main navigation menu.<br />
								- It has a link to an external page where one can listen to the MIDI of his compositions.<br />
								- Other than that, I did not use any background color, image or complex design elements as the main focus of this activity was to getting familiar with Codio IDE. <br /></p>
								<p>You can see my website live here: https://etking666.github.io/simplewebsite/ </p>
								<p>--------</p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
                						<p>- Types of networks: <b>PAN, LAN, MAN and WAN.</b><br />
								- The distinction between the topologies (e.g. bus or star) is whether the devices can communicate with each other directly (bus) or via an intermediary device (star).<br />
								- Protocols is a set of rules on how an activity is conducted.<br />
								- MAC protocols (ethernet): <b>CSMA/CD</b> (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collusion Detection), <b>CSMA/CA</b>  (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collusion Avoidance)<br />
								- <b>Internet</b> (with uppercase I) refers to a specific world wide internet, while <b>internet</b> (with lowercase i) refers to a network of networks which includes incompatible networks, where original networks retain their autonomy. <br />
								- Unlike repeaters, bridges and switches; <b>routers</b> provide links between the networks while allowing each network to retain their own characteristics.<br />
								- Each machine in a network has two addresses: Local address and internet address.<br />
								- Methods of interprocess communication: <b>client/server</b> model and <b>P2P</b> model. <br />
								- Types of distributed systems: <b>Cluster computing, grid computing, cloud computing</b>.<br />
								- <b>Last mile problem</b>: The issues arising from modern infrastructure (e.g. fiberoptic lines) been connected to analog linkages to provide connectivity to households, hence losing speed. <br />
								- <b>DNS lookup process:</b><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/dnslookup.png" alt="DNS Lookup Process"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1: DNS lookup Process (Javatpoint, N.D.).<br /></p>
								<p>- Internet Multimedia Streaming Techniques: N-unicast, Multicast, On-demand Streaming, Content Delivery Networks, Anycast.<br /> 
								- <b>XML</b> (eXtensible Markup Language): A stadardized style for designing notation systems for representing data as text files.<br /> 
								- 4 layers of the internet software. <b>(1) Application Layer, (2) Transport Layer), (3) Network Layer, (4) Link Layer</b>.<br />
								- The <b>port numbers</b> determine which unit within the application layer should receive the message. Port numbers are determined by the transportation layer.<br />  
								- "The application layer deals with messages from the application’s point of view. The transport layer converts these messages into segments that are compatible with the Internet and reassembles messages that are received before delivering them to the appropriate application. The network layer deals with directing the segments through the Internet. The link layer handles the actual transmission of segments from one machine to another" (Brookshear & Brylow, 2019: 234). <br />
								- Key concepts about autonomous cars: <b>Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicle-to-Sensor (V2S), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Internet (V2I), Vehicle-to-Road Infrastructure (V2R)</b>.<br />
