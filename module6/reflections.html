									<h1>Software Engineering Project Management</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In the first week of the new module, we had the chance to get a general idea about the history, practices and basic concepts of Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM). This is an area which I have had no experience so far. It was interesting to see how so many big projects failed due to bad project management, so the importance of SEPM is obvious. So far, it looks like an exciting and interesting field which brings so many disciplines of computer science together. </p>
								<p>I am also excited about the team projects that we will be working on during this module. The last team project in the Secure Software Engineering was really fun and above all, it was a very valuable learning experience, so I think this one will prove to be an amazing experience as well. So far, we were broken down into two groups and we met once to finalize the team contract. In the days ahead, we will familiarize ourselves with the assessment requirements and the documents provided and keep communicating with. each other on our Slack workspace.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Software engineering project management</b> requires knowledge of the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).</li>
									<li>A project manager is required <b>to manage the requirements, resources, stakeholders and expectations</b>.</li>
									<li>In <b>TOGAF ADM</b> (Architecture Development Method) is a 8-step methodology and includes Business, IT, Planning and Change portions.</li>
									<li>The common causes of project failure can be broken down into 9 categories:<br />
										<ul>
											<li>Market and Strategy</li>
											<li>Organization and Planning</li>
											<li>Leadership and Governance</li>
											<li>Estimation and Analysis</li>
											<li>Quality</li>
											<li>Risk</li>
											<li>Skills and Competency</li>
											<li>Communication and Engagement</li>
											<li>Complexity</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>Gherkin</b> is an English-like language that business users can use to describe their requirements. Gherkin can be compiled into unit tests so that the code can be continually tested for requirements compliance.</li>
									<li><b>Vision and Scope Document</b> is an important document to show the stakeholders that all of their requirements are understood at the beginning of the project.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>For me, the highlight of this unit was the Gherkin language. Even though, coming to this unit, I did not know anything about it, after reading about it and discussing it with the tutor during the seminar, I was easily convinced that it plays a crucial role in clearing the ambiguity during requirements gathering, albeit it may not be the only method to be used gather the requirements. Besides, thanks to behave (REF) framework in Python, it is pretty easy to turn requirements captured in Gherkin language into unit tests. I already tried expressing requirements in Gherkin language while working on the seminar preparation questions, but did not have the chance to put them to work using behave framework. Throughout the module, I intend to experiment both Gherkin and behave framework more.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Behavior-driven Development</b> (BDD) is a second-generation agile methodology developed as a response to Test-driven Development (TDD).</li>
									<li>BDD aims to achieve a clear understanding of the desired software behaviour through discussion with stakeholders (Engel et al., 2020).</li>
									<li>BDD extends TDD by writing test cases in natural language (using Gherkin) so that stakeholders with no programming background can easily read them. </li>
									<li>BDD uses “should” to describe the behaviour of the the software and “ensure” to describe the responsibilities of the software.</li>
									<li>BDD developers usually start the development by implementing the UI.</li>
									<li>In BDD methodology, mocks are frequently used as objects with predictable behaviour rather than the production version.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 3: Estimating, Planning and Risk</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>The cost estimation is a crucial step in the project management because it lays the foundation for the later phases like planning and development. This unit, we had the opportunity to get to know about some of the widely used estimation methods like COCOMO, Function Point and Expert Judgement. I am anxious to get my feet wet with the estimation methods in the team project.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>COCOMO</b> is the Constructive Cost Model and it is based on the number of lines of code (LOC) in a project.</li>
									<li><b>Function Point (FP)</b> estimation is a two-step process which is based on (1) the user functions and (2) adjustment for processing complexity.</li>
									<li><b>Expert Judgement</b> is one of the most common estimation methods in the industry. It involves including the development team in the evaluation process. Based on their previous experience, they produce estimates for new projects.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Risk Assessment and Estimating Tools</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This unit was all about the estimation methods and tools as well as risk assessment frameworks. We had a detailed information about estimation methods such as COCOMO, Function Points and so on. As part of the seminar preparations, I also developed a simple python application which allow the user to calculate the cost of the development of a software using basic COCOMO or Function Points methods. As the tutor pointed out during the seminar, even though COCOMO is basically based on LOC and therefore it is not a valid method anymore, it is still not completely obsolete as it provides a general idea about the project and may come in handy when used in combination with other estimation methods.</p>
