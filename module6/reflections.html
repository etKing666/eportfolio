									<h1>Software Engineering Project Management</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In the first week of the new module, we had the chance to get a general idea about the history, practices and basic concepts of Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM). This is an area which I have had no experience so far. It was interesting to see how so many big projects failed due to bad project management, so the importance of SEPM is obvious. So far, it looks like an exciting and interesting field which brings so many disciplines of computer science together. </p>
								<p>I am also excited about the team projects that we will be working on during this module. The last team project in the Secure Software Engineering was really fun and above all, it was a very valuable learning experience, so I think this one will prove to be an amazing experience as well. So far, we were broken down into two groups and we met once to finalize the team contract. In the days ahead, we will familiarize ourselves with the assessment requirements and the documents provided and keep communicating with. each other on our Slack workspace.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Software engineering project management</b> requires knowledge of the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).</li>
									<li>A project manager is required <b>to manage the requirements, resources, stakeholders and expectations</b>.</li>
									<li>In <b>TOGAF ADM</b> (Architecture Development Method) is a 8-step methodology and includes Business, IT, Planning and Change portions.</li>
									<li>The common causes of project failure can be broken down into 9 categories:<br />
										<ul>
											<li>Market and Strategy</li>
											<li>Organization and Planning</li>
											<li>Leadership and Governance</li>
											<li>Estimation and Analysis</li>
											<li>Quality</li>
											<li>Risk</li>
											<li>Skills and Competency</li>
											<li>Communication and Engagement</li>
											<li>Complexity</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>Gherkin</b> is an English-like language that business users can use to describe their requirements. Gherkin can be compiled into unit tests so that the code can be continually tested for requirements compliance.</li>
									<li><b>Vision and Scope Document</b> is an important document to show the stakeholders that all of their requirements are understood at the beginning of the project.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>For me, the highlight of this unit was the Gherkin language. Even though, coming to this unit, I did not know anything about it, after reading about it and discussing it with the tutor during the seminar, I was easily convinced that it plays a crucial role in clearing the ambiguity during requirements gathering, albeit it may not be the only method to be used gather the requirements. Besides, thanks to behave (REF) framework in Python, it is pretty easy to turn requirements captured in Gherkin language into unit tests. I already tried expressing requirements in Gherkin language while working on the seminar preparation questions, but did not have the chance to put them to work using behave framework. Throughout the module, I intend to experiment both Gherkin and behave framework more.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Behavior-driven Development</b> (BDD) is a second-generation agile methodology developed as a response to Test-driven Development (TDD).</li>
									<li>BDD aims to achieve a clear understanding of the desired software behaviour through discussion with stakeholders (Engel et al., 2020).</li>
									<li>BDD extends TDD by writing test cases in natural language (using Gherkin) so that stakeholders with no programming background can easily read them. </li>
									<li>BDD uses “should” to describe the behaviour of the the software and “ensure” to describe the responsibilities of the software.</li>
									<li>BDD developers usually start the development by implementing the UI.</li>
									<li>In BDD methodology, mocks are frequently used as objects with predictable behaviour rather than the production version.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 3: Estimating, Planning and Risk</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>The cost estimation is a crucial step in the project management because it lays the foundation for the later phases like planning and development. This unit, we had the opportunity to get to know about some of the widely used estimation methods like COCOMO, Function Point and Expert Judgement. I am anxious to get my feet wet with the estimation methods in the team project.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>COCOMO</b> is the Constructive Cost Model and it is based on the number of lines of code (LOC) in a project.</li>
									<li><b>Function Point (FP)</b> estimation is a two-step process which is based on (1) the user functions and (2) adjustment for processing complexity.</li>
									<li><b>Expert Judgement</b> is one of the most common estimation methods in the industry. It involves including the development team in the evaluation process. Based on their previous experience, they produce estimates for new projects.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Risk Assessment and Estimating Tools</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This unit was all about the estimation methods and tools as well as risk assessment frameworks. We had a detailed information about estimation methods such as COCOMO, Function Points and so on. As part of the seminar preparations, I also developed a simple python application which allow the user to calculate the cost of the development of a software using basic COCOMO or Function Points methods. As the tutor pointed out during the seminar, even though COCOMO is basically based on LOC and therefore it is not a valid method anymore, it is still not completely obsolete as it provides a general idea about the project and may come in handy when used in combination with other estimation methods.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 5: User Experience</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>User experience (UX) is without a doubt one of the most important aspects of system development. This month, we had the chance to get valuable information about the basic concepts of UX such as CUE, Togg’s Principles or Fitt’s Law.  Even though the importance of UX seems obvious, there are many factors and layers that goes into it. That’s why this unit’s content was seminal and it helped me to raise my awareness towards the factors that should be taken into consideration in order to provide a quality user experience.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>UX metrics</b> can be behavioural or attitudinal.</li>
									<li><b>Behavioural metrics</b> capture what a user does. For example: Abandonment rate, page views, problems and frustrations, task success, and task time. </li>
									<li><b>Attitudinal metrics</b> capture how a user feels and says before, during and after using a product or a system.</li>
									<li><b>Project owner</b> is the one who decides what to build and what not to build. He/she therefore manages the Product Backlog and the business stakeholders.</li>
									<li><b>Project manager</b> oversees the whole project and ensures that, among others, the deadlines and requirements are met.</li>
									<li>The triple constraints of project management: time, cost and scope.</li>
									<li><b>Project plans</b> include: (1) Project Initiation Document, (2) Project Plan, (3) Gantt Chart.</li>
									<li>A <b>Project Initiation Document (PID)</b> involves the review and preparation of project roles, project board, initial stakeholder assessment, scoping, business case and project governance documentation. </li>
									<li><b>Tog's Principles of Interaction Design</b>: Aesthetics, Anticipation, Autonomy, Colour, Consistency, Defaults, Discoverability, Efficiency of the user, and Explorable interfaces.</li>
									<li><b>Fitt's Law</b> considers usability from the perspective of how long it takes someone to use a product or system in relation to moving around on screen. </li>
									<li><b>AARRR framework</b> relies on five metrics to determine the quality of work of an organization: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 6: pytest and Test-Driven Development</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Testing (especially unit testing) is a topic I am already familiar with for a long time. I get the habit of using the python's built-in unit testing library unittest to test my code and so far it worked just fine for me. After reading about the advantages that pytest offers (Hillard, 2022) I was convinced that I should start using pytest instead of unittest. I especially liked the idea of using pytest fixtures and also it was very interesting for me to see how pytest reduces the boilerplate. The way ahead for me will definitely to get my feet wet with pytest starting from my next python project.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b><u>Best practice</u></b>: “Each piece of behavior should be tested once -- and only once. Testing the same behavior more than once does not mean that your software is more likely to work. Tests need to be maintained too. If you make a small change to your code base and then twenty tests break, how do you know which functionality is broken? When only a single test fails, it's much easier to find the bug.” (Giacomelli, 2022)</li>
									<li><b>Test pyramid</b>: Unit tests (50%), integration tests (30%), end-to-end tests (20%). In simple applications, it may be 40% unit tests, 40% integration tests and 20% end-to-end tests ("house" shape).</li>
									<li><b>What to test?</b> You should always test the behaviour of the software so that you don't have to change the tests everytime there is a change in the code base.</li>
									<li>When unit testing, focus should be on testing the functions and methods that are publicly exposed from a module/package.</li>
									<li>Instead of the .setUp() and .tearDown() methods in unittest, pytest offers the <b>fixtures</b> to create test data. pytest fixtures are functions that can create data, test doubles, or initialize system state for the test suite.  </li>
									<li><b>When to use fixtures</b>: If the tests rely on the same underlying test data, you can create text fixtures to avoid writing repetitive code.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 7: Software Development Life Cycles</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week, we looked into the different Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models and the advantages and disadvantages they offer from software engineering project management perspective. It was particularly interesting to see how each of these models differ in handling the customer requirements but how each of them somehow try to incorporate the customer to the process. For example, in the Three Amigos meetings (in agile), product owner (or business analyst) represents the customer; whereas in Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) customers with no technical background can easily discuss the requirements with developers via Gherkin language. ePortfolio activity provided a nice opportunity to think about how to handle the emotional reactions of the customer throughout the project. </p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models are broken into two: <b>Adaptive</b> and <b>Predictive</b>.</li>
									<li>Adaptive models: Scrum, Extreme Programming, Feature-driven Development, Kanban, Test-driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-driven Development (BDD).</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.volere.org/templates/volere-requirements-specification-template/">Volere Requirements Specification Template</a> is a tool that can be used to capture the customer requirements.</li>
									<li>Requirements must be S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound).</li>
									<li><b>Work Breakdown Structure</b> (WBS) defines all the tasks that a project needs to complete and, essentially, it captures the deliverables of a project. It is a hierarchical structure of things that the project will make or outcomes that it will deliver.</li>
									<li><b>Test Driven Development</b> (TDD) is an approach where you write a test before writing production code to fulfill the tests and refactoring.</li>
									<li><b>Extreme Programming</b> is “is a discipline of software development based on values of simplicity, communication, feedback, and courage” (Jeffries, 2011). It relies on the ‘whole team’, pair programming, small releases, continuous integration, test-driven development, refactoring, sustainable pace, metaphor, and collective code ownership.</li>
									<li><b>The Three Amigos</b>: The business (or product owner), the developer and, the tester.</li>
									<li>The different perspectives of amigos:
										<ul>
											<li>Business – What problem are we trying to solve?</li>
											<li>Developer – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?</li>
											<li>Tester – What about this, what could possibly happen?</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>- Dynamics of the triple constraint (Wyngaard et al., 2012)
										<ul>
											<li>S↑ α T↑ C↑</li>
											<li>T↓ α S↓ C↑</li>
											<li>C↓ α S↓ T↑</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>Technical debt</b> is the maintenance obligations arising from shortcuts taken during the design, development, and deployment of software systems.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 8: Software Development Life Cycles</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Data structures play a crucial role in the design of the systems, since because they not only store the data but also factor in when determining the overall efficiency of the system. This week we reviewed the data structures and when to use each of them. The choice of data structure will also play an important part in the Assignment 2.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Data processing systems</b> are generally divided into two categories: (1) <b>Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)</b> and (2) <b>Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)</b>.</li>
									<li><b>OLTP</b> usually deals with a large number of atomic operations such as inserts, updates and deletes.</li>
									<li><b>OLAP</b> is focused on bulk data processing (bulk reads and writes) with low volume of transactions.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 9: Quality Management Strategy</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Quality is arguably the most critical concept within the concept of triple constraint and one of the most important aspects that a project manager should manage. Despite its importance there is hardly a consensus about its definition, quanitative metrics to measure it and its characteristics. In this respect, this unit provided useful information about different perspectives on the issue and encouraged me to think about how a project manager should behave in order to assure the quality of the product and avoid any frictions with the client. It also helpmed me to develop a better understanding of the stages of quality management and what goes into each phase, most importantly the quality control phase.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>According to IEEE, quality is "the totality of features and characteristics of a software product that bear on its ability to satisfy given needs: for example, conform to specifications".</li>
									<li>In order to avoid any subjectivity in terms of quality, quality metrics have to be agreed with the client and these have to be clearly defined.</li>
									<li>According to the Project Management Institute, <b>project quality management</b> involves three stages: quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control. </li>
									<li>A <b>quality assurance plan</b> will include a purpose section, a software configuration management section, problem reporting and corrective action section, tools, technologies and methodologies section, code control section, and testing methodology, among a few others.</li>
									<li><b>Quality control phase</b> is fed by: project management plan, quality metrics, quality checklist, work performance data, approved change requests, as well as deliverables. </li>
									<li>Outputs from the quality control process include quality control measurements, validated changes, verified deliverables, work performance information and change requests.</li>
									<li>The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) / International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), in recommendation 9126, defines six characteristics of quality: <b>Functionality, Reliability, Effectiveness, Usability, Maintainability, Portability</b>.</li>
									<li>ISO/IEC 25010, which was issued in 2011 superseded 9126. It contains eight product quality characteristics: <b>Functional Suitability, Performance Efficiency, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Portability</b> </li>
									<li><b>McCall</b>'s 1977 model has eleven characteristics: <b>Integrity, Reliability, Usability, Accuracy, Efficiency, Maintainability, Testability, Flexibility, Interoperability, Reusability, Portability</b>.</li>
									<li><b>Manual testing</b> is more suitable for small projects, minor changes or GUI-oriented projects whereas <b>automated testing</b> is more suitable for ongoing projects, frequent changes or ensuring high performance.</li>
								</ul>
