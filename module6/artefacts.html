								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Initial Post): The Risks of Digitalisation (Unit 1):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Please read the Itkonen et al. (2014) paper and then answer the following questions:</p>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?</li>
										<li>Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<p>In my opinion, the three most common reasons for project failure are:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><b>Lack of testing</b>: As Itkonen et al. (2014) pointed out in their paper, lack of proper testing procedures is a common problem regardless of the type of the project or failure in question. Testing is commonly seen as a burden and the development teams incline to refrain from allocating it sufficient time especially when there is a pressure from the management in terms of avoiding unnecessary costs (both in terms of money and time). A mitigation to this problem would be to adopt test-centric approaches like Test-Driven Development.</li>
									<li><b>Inaccurate estimation and analysis</b>: Inaccurate estimation of time needed to deliver the project or the project budget leads to unrealistic expectations and a potential deadlock in which more budget is needed whereas the contracting company is reluctant to provide it. Sometimes, the opposite may be true as well: Specifications change after signing the contract and it leads to a budget that is higher than expected. The budget conflicts are arguably one of the most common reasons of project failure.</li>
									<li><b>Inadequate skills and incompetency</b>: Especially in today’s world where outsourcing even the smallest projects is commonplace, it is quite possible that the contractor company may lack the talent needed to meet the requirements, even more so considering today’s highly competitive market. </li>
								</ol>
								<p>F-35 Lightning II project suffered from many different types of failure throughout years, making it the costliest defence project to date (Gregg, 2021). At the beginning of the project, F35 was projected to replace some certain types of aircraft in US Army’s inventory, however, over time the specifications changed, and it was decided that, by making “small” modification to the project in hand, a broader range of aircrafts could be replaced by F35 (Why Projects Fail, 2023). However, this led to an increase of the project budget to $1.7T (Bunch, 2023). Besides, the project was delayed significantly (Losey, 2023) due to design and software flaws which could have been avoided by a robust development methodology and proper testing (Grazier, 2021). Here, referring to categories of common failures mentioned in the lecture cast, we can see that this failure touches many of them, including Market and Strategy, Organization and Planning, Estimation and Analysis, Quality and Complexity.</p>
								<p>We can see a similar scenario playing out in London Stock Exchange’s (LSE) Taurus project (Hargreaves, 2020). LSE continued adding new features to the project specification which resulted in a much more complex project than the way it was projected at the beginning. In the end, unlike F35 project, the project was abandoned altogether (McRae, 1993) and the £500-worth of investments (Why Projects Fail, 2022) by the stakeholders and the exchange itself was wasted.</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: Requirements Gathering (Unit 2):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read the Behaviour Driven Development (2020) pages and then use the Gherkin language to create a Gherkin sequence that addresses ONE of the following examples:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Using a new coffee making machine.</li>
									<li>Interfacing with a new SatNav system.</li>
									<li>Using a computer running the Linux operating system.</li>
									<li>Getting familiar with a new vehicle.</li>
									<li>Creating a batch or shell script.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Your response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver and so on. </p>
								<h3>My response:</h3>
								<p>I chose the "Getting familiar with a new vehicle" scenario for the exercise and came up with four scenarios and expressed them in Gherkin language. During the seminar, I also had the opportunity to present my scenarios to the tutor and gather his feedback.</p>
								<p>You can see my scenarios in <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFid9_-m6o/Ic1rbMYASCDLjg8ksKE4ww/edit?utm_content=DAFid9_-m6o&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">this presentation</a>.</p>

								<h2>e-Portfolio Activity: Data Structures Reflection (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Dicheva & Hodge (2018). Think about an online system which you use on a daily basis. Consider how it might operate at the back-end using data structures. This will inform our discussion during next week’s seminar.</p>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>The old version of our company portal used to allow us to go back to the previous page we viewed by clicking on “Previous” button (much like a browser’s previous & next buttons). I assume that the pages that the user viewed was saved in a stack (like it was discussed by Dicheva & Hodge (2018)) so that when the user hits “previous” button, the page at the top of the stack is retrieved and dequeued (just like pop() method in python) and it goes on like this until the stack is empty.</p>
