									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>

								</p>
								<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit</h3>
								<p>The main theme of the first unit was the computing as a profession and the challenges and threats involved in the modern world of advanced technology. Considerable amount of reading was focused on the ethics and regulations of several professional bodies such as IEEE or BCS. Another important topic was the threat posed on the privacy. Apparently, a lot of data about individuals is gathered on various venues (social media, health apps, etc.) without explicit consent and this leads to privacy issues. Even when the data is gathered with consent, problems occur when the data is processed extensively. In order to prevent such issues, some precautions and legislation like GDPR is put in place. Finally, we had the opportunity to gain a general understanding of cyber security, common threats (e.g. virus, worms, Trojan horse, etc.) and the measures to prevent them (e.g. antivirus software, firewall, etc.).</p>
								<p>We also had a chance to discuss the career path we would like to take, and the challenges attached to it. I read many interesting ideas from the fellow students, and especially the discussion about the AI caught my attention as this is a rising, and nevertheless, a controversial field. </p> 
								<p>In my opinion, this unit was more about informing the would-be computer scientists about the ethics of their future profession as well as the rules that they must adhere to. Since misconduct would lead to serious consequences, I think this was the right approach. After reading about the aforementioned topics, I feel more confident about ‘dos and don’ts’ of the computing professionals. Moreover, the information we had about the cybersecurity threats is very useful both for our daily lives as well as for our future profession.</p>
								<p>From this point onwards, having read about much of the rules and regulations about privacy, I will be more sceptical about personal data when working on user-facing projects. Furthermore, even though I already knew a lot about the types of cyber security threats, the chapter about cybersecurity helped me to cement my knowledge.</p>
								<p>All in all, this unit provided me with a fresh perspective which, I believe, will prove useful during my studies in coming weeks and months.</p>

                						<h3>Forum discussion: </h3>
								<p><i>What IT role would you like to assume and what kind of challenges are attached to the role you selected?</i></p>
                						<p>Personally, I am interested in the role of software developer, possibly not as a full-stack developer (Taivalsaari et al., 2021) but rather, a developer who is focused on a specific skill and working in a larger team.<br />
								I believe, among the main challenges for this role are:<br />
								- <b>Competence</b>: I need to have the necessary knowledge in a number of programming languages as well as some other tools which could come in handy in software development.<br />
								- <b>Self-learning</b>: I need to keep my competence up to date by constantly monitoring the latest developments in the field of Computer Science, be it a new programming language or a new concept, etc.<br />
								- <b>Teamwork</b>: Since I am more interested in working in a team in large projects rather than working alone, I need to display a positive attitude towards my colleagues and be able to work with them in harmony. This also includes helping my teammates to develop themselves and learning from them.<br />
								- <b>Ethics</b>: I must adhere to the code of ethics accepted widely by the industry (BCS, 2021).</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways: </h3>
								<p>- Types of cyber attacks include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, phishing, spam, denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS).<br />
								- Protection measures against the cyber attacks include firewalls, spam filters, proxy servers, antivirus software and various techniques called “cryptography” (encryption, certificates, authentication, digital signatures, etc.)<br />
								- There is a thin line between sharing one’s personal information on voluntary and involuntary basis.<br />
								- The data collected by the companies (sometimes with a small incentive like a discount) are very precious, but the innovative way to use them (such as identifying purchase patterns of customers and offering them a customized promotional campaigns) make it much more valuable.<br />
								- The most powerful way to avoid the database abuses is the public opinion. Legal punishments and fines might prove useful, but what most companies fear most is a negative public opinion against themselves.<br />
								- There are a lot of codes and rules published by national bodies or professional associations about how to handle the personal data as well as the ethics of IT professionals. While each of them is unique in the way they are structured or written, all of them converge towards a more responsible use of personal date, a greater care to privacy and an ethical way to practice the professions - which leads us to some globally accepted principles.</p>
