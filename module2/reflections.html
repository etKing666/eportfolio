									<h1>Object Oriented<br />
									Programming</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								</p>
								<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This unit focuses on the concept of object orientation and python. The syntax, initialization of objects and how to access the object variables were the main topics covered. The discussion about the philosophical aspect of object oriented approach (Joque, 2016) was particularly interesting. Other topics of interest were the overview of Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the importance of software reusability.</p>
								<p>One of the most important points for me this week was to choose an IDE to work on. I used to work on VS Code and AWS Cloud9, but I was looking for a simpler tool which would help me to code in an easier and faster manner. Thanks to the recommendations by Reitz & Schlusser (2016) I had a chance to have a look at the different options and decided to use PyCharm for now. It seems like it is more lightweight compared to VS Code and offers templates for frameworks like Flask or Django. </p> 
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Forum discussion: </h3>
								<p><i>Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software. In this collaborative discussion, you are required to prioritise this list, presenting your argument for the priorities assigned.</i></p>
                						<p>Software reuse is a fundamental factor to make progress in the field of software engineering and design robust software, and to benefit from the research and progress that the software engineers and developers have made until today. Regarding the reusable properties listed by N. Padhy et al. (2018), from my point of view, the order of priority is as follows:<br />
								<ol>
									<li>An algorithm used in the program (AP)</li>
									<li>Models in the project (MP)</li>
									<li>3. Design patterns (DP)</li>
									<li>4. Modules in the program (MIP)</li>
									<li>Test cases/test design (TCTD)
									<li>Used in the data project (UD)</li>
									<li>Knowledge requirement (KR)</li>
									<li>Requirement analysis (RA)</li>
									<li>Documentation in project (DIP)</li>
									<li>Architecture driven approach (ADP)</li>
									<li>Service contracts (SC)</li>
								</ol>
								As all developers and practitioners know by experience, libraries which include off-the-shelf algorithms and codes that can be used in a variety of cases are the greatest timesavers (Kang, 2005). Since it is evident that the libraries, which include AP and partly MP, are the backbones of software reusability and they make the biggest impact on the code reuse, I think the AP and MP belong to the top of the list. <br />
								In my opinion, software design is one of the most challenging aspects of software engineering. However, at the same time, it is relatively easy to benefit from the existing design patterns (DP) and modules (MIP) and implement them to another project. For instance, in the case of web applications, Flask provides a framework which saves the developers from the burden of starting the design process from scratch. <br />
								Finally, the development of test cases and test data could be quite tedious, especially for big projects that are working on a sizable database. In such cases, standardized test cases and test data may come in handy (TCTD) and help developers to test their software more efficiently.<br />
								According to me, the remainder of the factors rank below these five properties. <br /></p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>e-Portfolio Activities: </h3>
								<p><i>Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). Discuss one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.</i></p>
                						<p>The value of ePortfolios in terms of reflective learning and personal growth is obvious, as demonstrated Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). However, what was the most striking in the article was how ePortfolios helps the students to become better team players. Before reading the article, I saw the ePortfolio development as a personal process without a meaningful interaction with peers in which the student reflects on his/her learning process and also showcase any artifacts he/she may want in order to prove his/her competency in a field. However, after reading the article and the research results, I figured out that it was not the case. Apparently, thanks to today’s highly interactive ePortfolios, students exchange their views, correct the mistakes of fellow students and comment on the work of their peers. Without a doubt, this interaction helps students to obtain one of the most important and sought-for qualifications in today’s business world: Ability to work in a team coherently, making a meaningful contribution to the team as a whole, and helping each of the fellow members of the team to succeed and improve. </p>

								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<p>- Objects are user-defined data types that has two components: attributes and behaviours. <br />
								- Shallow copy copies the contents of the objects and references to embedded objects. On the other hand, deep copy copies the contents of the objects as well ass all the embedded objects.<br />
								- The encapsulation is "the distinction between the inside and the outside of the object" (Jocque, 2016: 345)<br />
								- Version Control Systems (VCS) can be classified as Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). Git is an example of DVCS.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								</p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week I had a deeper understanding of UML and use case diagrams. I especially found the articles about the usefulness of the use case diagrams pretty interesting. Apparently, many skeptics do not agree to the value of use case diagrams during the requirement analysis or they find other tools (e.g. class diagrams, etc.) more useful. Some researchers even suggest some additional notation to make up for the shortcomings of use case diagrams. However, I strongly think that use case diagrams prove useful in identifying the actors and the main functionalities of a system. </p>
								<p>This unit’s Codio activities included important concepts like class, functions and methods. I also wrote a small Python program which comprises of basic employee functions. As part of my independent research about protected variables, I found out that in Python, the concept of “protected variables” is only a convention. In fact, it is possible to access the protected variables from outside the class. However, when programmers see the protected variable notation (e.g. _variable), they take it as a warning from the developer to not to access it from outside the class.</p>
								<p>The last but not the least, you can see the pen portrait for a user of a driverless car and a use case diagram that depicts how the user interacts with the car in the <a href="artefacts.html">Artefacts</a> section.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<p>- <b>Pure functions</b>: A pure function does not modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments and it has no effect, like displaying a value or getting user input, other than returning a value. <br />
									- <b>Modifiers</b>: Modifiers are functions that modify the objects they get as parameters. In that case, the changes are visible to the caller.<br />
									- In order to make the software more maintainable, it is best to keep interfaces separate from implementations. In case of OOP and objects, methods of a class should not depend on how the attributes are represented.<br />
									- Requirements that should always be true in a code are called <b>invariants</b><br />
									- The values of <b>class variables</b> are the same in all objects/instances. However, the values of <b>instance variables</b> (e.g. __init__()) may change in every object/instance depending on the parameters passed.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 3: UML</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>The main theme of the Unit 3 was the different views of UML, and its shortcomings. As we can clearly see, even though it is an indispensable tool in the arsenal of a developer, it is still far from perfect. The most striking finding was that the freedom it provides (e.g. lack of formal semantics) is also its biggest weakness. There are numerous proposed solutions to overcome such difficulties, but the biggest concern here is that UML may lose its flexibility as part of the efforts to introduce strict rules to be followed.</p>
								<p>As someone new to UML, this discussion proved very useful to me. In the future, I will certainly consider these shortcomings when using UML, especially when working with other developers who may have different perceptions of UML.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Forum discussion (Summary post): </h3>
								<p>It has been a fruitful discussion in the forum. To summarize, I prioritized the reusable properties listed by N. Padhy et al. (2018) and ranked algorithms used in the program (AP) first followed by models in the project (MP), design patterns (DP) and modules in the program (MIP).</p>
								<p>The feedback I received from my peers were very useful and interesting. As some of them pointed out, I might have attached too little importance to the Requirement Analysis but after much thinking and careful examination of the feedback and posts of my peers, I still think that algorithms and models make a greater impact in terms of software reusability.</p>
								<p>To clarify my point of view, I would like to underline two important points:</p>
								<p>1. My prioritized list in my initial list is not meant to be in sequential order. As Zukiswa pointed out, I agree that the Requirement Analysis should precede the other steps so that we can find out what the requirements of the projects are. However, since we were expected to put the reusable properties in the order of priority, I opted to put them in the order of importance (i.e. the impact they make on the software design). Therefore, the ones that save the developers more time or effort rank first.</p>
								<p>2. The Python libraries/modules/packages are arguably most practical example of my point of view on the extent of usability and the impact reusing algorithms and pieces of code make. For instance, let’s take a closer look at math (2022) module which includes handy functions like factorial, perm and trigonometric functions. Without this module, one would have to write each function from scratch. Likewise, the famous Python package Tensorflow (2022) allows developers to reuse the community-created models. This way, it helps to do a lot of things with minimal effort. </p>
								<p>In a nutshell, I think algorithms and models should be ranked at the top of the list when it comes to software reusability because of the reasons I have explained above. </p>
								<p><b>Note:</b> The references are incorporated into the reference list in the end of the page.</p>

								<h3>e-Portfolio Activities: </h3>
								<p><i>Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.</i></p>
								<p>As far as I see, there is no commonly agreed structure of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and it is typically divided into 5 to 8 steps. I will use the 6-step SDLC to demonstrate which UML models and diagrams should be used throughout the process.</p>
								<p><b>Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis</b><br />
									Model management view<br />
									Use case diagram<br /></p>
								<p><b>Stage 2: Defining Requirements</b><br />
									Use case diagram<br />
									Collaboration diagram<br /></p>
								<p><b>Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture</b><br />
									Class diagram<br />
									State machine diagram<br />
									Collaboration diagram</p>
								<p><b>Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product</b><br />
									Sequence diagram<br />
									Class diagram <br /></p>
								<p><b>Stage 5: Testing the Product</b><br />
									Use case diagram<br />
									Class diagram<br />
									Activity diagram <br /></p>
								<p><b>Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance</b><br />
									Deployment diagram<br />
									Model management view<br /></p>
								<p><i>Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to design a similar model for a washing machine.</i></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../images/m2u3_washingmachine.png" alt="State machine diagram for a washing machine"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1: State machine diagram for a washing machine.<br /></p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<p>- A <b>UML view</b> - is a subset of UML modeling constructs.<br />
									- The views are broken down into three areas: <b>structural classification, dynamic behavior, and model management.</b><br />
									- Lack of a formal UML semantics and the freedom it provides lead to different interpretation of UML by practitioners. <br />
									- Since the specifications of a design are scattered over multiple views, they can easily go unnoticed. <br /></p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In this unit, further UML models were introduced, including the class diagram which helps to identify the classes that would be used in a program. A class typically includes attributes and methods (or functions). I think apart from the other UML models, class diagrams are especially important for object oriented programming because it helps a lot to think about classes that would be instantiated as objects.</p>
								<p>Moreover, we had the opportunity to see class, sequence, state and activity diagrams in action with examples in this week’s seminar. The approach introduced by the tutor to identify the classes from a pen portrait or a description of a program was especially useful for me.</p>
								<p>Finally, a couple of IDEs were introduced in this week’s additional reading. While each of them seems to be a good choice for a python IDE, my two favorites are: 1. PyCharm because it has a very intuitive interface and offers some handy features such as templates for frameworks like Flask. 2. Visual Studio Code because it supports multiple programming languages and also variety of plugins to extend its functionality and allow using 3rd party services like AWS or Azure.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<p>- Lack of active objects and the inability to depict interaction between actors stand out as two important deficiencies of UML.<br />
									- Interaction between use cases is impossible to model in UML. This is another important shortcoming which should be overcome. <br /></p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 5: More on Classes</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Relatively more complex subjects like abstract base classes and decorators were explored with examples in this unit. Personally, I did not use the decorators in my code writing practices until this week, but having learnt the power of decorators, I am willing to employ them in the way ahead. Even though I am not sure how the interfaces can be useful yet, I am sure I will figure it out through practice.</p>
								<p>Pair programming was another interesting concept that was introduced this week. It seems especially useful to transfer knowledge from the senior programmers to novice programmers. Since it is also possible to practice pair programming in a remote environment, remote teams can also capitalize on it.</p>
								<p>As part of the e-portfolio activities, I have written small Python program in which I employed polymorphism (method overriding). You can see my code on the Module’s Artefacts page.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<p>- <b>Abstract base classes</b> provide a blueprint for concrete classes and do not include the implementation.<br />
									- Types of <b>interfaces</b> in Python: 1. Informal (methods can be overridden) 2. Formal (uses Python’s ABC module).<br />
									- Types of <b>polymorphism</b>: Dynamic polymorphism (method overriding), coercion, sub typing, parametric polymorphism.<br />
									- <b>Duck typing</b> is a concept where the type/class of an object is less important than its methods. The programmer do not check types but check the presence of a method or attribute.<br />
									- A <b>decorator</b> is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of this function without explicitly modifying it (Hjelle, 2018).<br />
									- <b>Pair programming</b> is the practice where two people write code together on one machine. Usually, one of them (preferably the more experienced one) assumes the “navigator” role and focuses on the strategy and double-checking the code that’s being written and the other one (less experienced one) assumes the “driver” role and writes the code, focusing on the tactical side. These two switch roles regularly  (Böckeler & Siessegger, 2020).<br /></p>
