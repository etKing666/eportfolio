								<h2>A pen portrait and a use case diagram for a driverless car:</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p>I have created this pen portrait and the use case diagram as part of the seminar preparations. Instructions for the tasks were as follows:</p>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Write a pen portrait for a user of a driverless car. Create a use case model which captures the ways in which a user needs to interact with the software system.</p>
								<h3>Pen portrait of a user of a driverless car: </h3>
								<p>Tom is the CEO of a big company. He uses an autonomous car to go to his office every morning. He has the habit of making use of the travel time to get prepared for the day ahead. Fortunately, equipped with the latest information technologies, his autonomous car helps him a lot. Once he starts his car, the car software automatically checks the fuel (something he had to do himself before getting this car), the tires and the sensors around the car. When the car starts, using voice commands, Tom asks the software to fetch the latest news headlines and the stock price of his company as well as that of the rivals. Then, he asks the mail app to check his inbox for new messages. If he has new mails in his inbox, he makes the mail app read the message and he replies to his messages. Thanks to the advanced features of the car, when he gets to the office, he is ready to start the day on a high note. After a long and tiring day at the office, he wants to relax on his way back home. All seats of the car are equipped with heart rate and blood pressure sensors. So, the car software checks the heart rate and blood pressure of Tom and selects an appropriate playlist depending on Tom’s mood. When he gets back home, he is full refreshed and ready to spend some quality time with his children!</p>

								<h2>A Python program with polymorphism:</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Write a Python program with polymorphism that is usable within the summative assessment for the driverless car.</p>
								<p>In this piece of code, I displayed polymorphism in terms of method overriding. I created Vehicle() superclass and two child subclasses Car() and Truck(). The child classes inherited the attributes of the superclass, but the print_state() method of the superclass was overridden by the child classes with a method of the same name. Hence, even though it is possible to call the method of the child classes with the same name as that of the superclass, it behaves differently.</p>
								<p>You can check out the code from <a href="https://github.com/etKing666/MSc_Module2/blob/master/polymorphism.py">here</a>.</p>
