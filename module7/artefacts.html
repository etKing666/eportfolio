								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Initial Post): Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Unit 1)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Pick a case study from the examples provided by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies">Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>. Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<p>In the case study (ACM, N.D.) in which a technical leader displayed abusive workplace behaviour towards a team member, we can see several violations of the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022).</p>
								<p>First and foremost, it is obvious that the technical leader (Max) resorts to gender-biased behaviour by removing the names of the woman researchers and contributors from the list of authors of the manuscripts submitted to the journals. His biased attitude may also be traced to his relationship with the subject of his abusive behaviour (Diana). However, according to the first principle of the BCS Code of Conduct, IT professionals should not discriminate against others based on gender. The same principle is also echoed by ACM in the Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018). In addition to the ethical implications, Max's behaviour also has some legal implications. According to the Equality Act (2010), sex is one of the protected characteristics and discriminative behaviour in the case study is evidently unlawful. </p>
								<p>The behaviour of Max also breaches the 4th pillar of the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) which stipulates that all IT professionals should be supportive of each other and encourage other professionals in their professional development. However, by putting them down and not giving them the credit they deserve for their hard work, Max obviously doesn't display supportive behaviour in this respect.</p>
								<p>However, what's even more striking to me in the case study is the organisational negligence against the obvious violations of the code of conduct. As we can see in the case study, Diana asks Jane (the team manager) for help only to find out that she took this behaviour for granted. This suggests organisational negligence towards abusive behaviour in the workplace. The managers of the organisation may think that the only way to keep the "brainchild" (Max) is to turn a blind eye on his problematic attitude, but as suggested by Tziner et al. (2023), such an approach may have far-reaching psychological, organisational and economic implications, and may eventually lead to various negative long-term consequences.</p>
								<p>All in all, I think the case study is a perfect example of how abusive behaviour prevails within an organisation when not responded to in a timely and efficient manner by the top management.</p>

								<h2>Reflective activity: Ethics in Computing (Unit 1)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2005) Chapter 1.</p>
								<p>Your response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver and so on. </p>
								<p>In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that “many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”</p>
								<p>Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.</p>
								<h3>My response:</h3>
								<p>I considered myself as the leader of a team which is responsible to maintain the website of a media outlet and discussed some of the possible ethical issues I may face.</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: Peer Review Activity (Unit 3)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing field of your choice that utilise the two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?</li>
									<li>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li>
									<li>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)</li>
									<li>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?</li>
									<li>How would you enhance the work/paper?</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>For this activity, I chose two papers that elaborated on the adoption of cloud computing, namely: "Cloud computing technology adoption: an evaluation of key factors in local governments" (Article 1) (Ali et al., 2021) and "Government Cloud Computing and National Data Sovereignty" (Article 2) (Irion, 2012). I prepared a <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFsMH8FkCk/6BBfbjjCSKP8rD_PvqqQOw/edit?utm_content=DAFsMH8FkCk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">presentation</a> outlining the basic features of the two studies.</p>
								<p>To begin with, I am already familiar with cloud concepts and the implementation of cloud-based services, and I found out that both studies are in line with my expectations from a study in respective fields. </p>
								<p>Article 1, which tries to identify critical factors that have an impact on the adoption of cloud-based services, relies on a quantitative method and gathers data from a relatively large sample. On the other hand, Article 2, which explores the national data sovereignty issues in a number of countries, relies on observations from the countries in question, hence, it relies on a qualitative approach. I think that both approaches are fit for the purpose of the respective papers, especially when you consider that it may not be proper to collect data directly from governmental agencies and people working for these agencies.</p>
								<p>In Article 1, the researchers start by formulating some hypothesis, apply some statistical models to the data gathered, and go on to compare the results against the hypothesis and draw conclusions. This approach leaves no question mark about the evidential basis of the research. In Article 2, the researcher starts with the definition of the concepts and framing the question in hand, analyses the national cloud computing strategies of the chosen countries, and draws conclusions based on the comparative analysis of the strategies and the state of the multilateral regulation of cloud services. So, it is safe to say that Article 2 looks more like a literature review. With that being said, even though the claims and conclusions are not supported by statistics, I’d argue that all conclusions made are based on sound observation and reasoning.</p>
								<p>Finally, in my opinion, Article 1 may be improved in two ways: As it is also stated in the limitations, the data is only gathered from Queensland, Australia. In order to increase the generalisability of the results, more data can be gathered from elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the types of cloud-based models should also be accounted for in order to develop a better understanding of how these different cloud adoption models make an impact on the subject area – this limitation is also acknowledged by the authors. As far as Article 2 is concerned, since the article is a little bit outdated (it is dated 2012), from my current standpoint, I would improve this article by updating it with the recent developments that cloud-based services have seen especially when it comes to the implementation and data sovereignty. I also think that the conclusions may be supported by a survey (however challenging it may be) to gather data from government officials and industry professionals (e.g., cloud service providers).</p>

								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Summary Post): Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Continue with the Unit 1 Discussion forum. You should now provide a summary post into to the discussion in Unit 1 based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. Please try to limit your posts to 200-300 words maximum.</p>
								<h3>My summary post:</h3>
								<p>I believe that abusive workplace behaviour is one of the most pressing issues in today’s business world. We hear stories about discrimination in the workplace based on race or gender or similar issues almost every day. In the case study (ACM, N.D.) we see a similar pattern: the technical leader displays an abusive attitude by removing the names of women researchers from the name of contributors of the manuscripts submitted to journals, and also behaves inappropriately towards another coworker. As we can clearly see, he violates a number of principles of the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022). As I also pointed out in my initial post, what was more striking to me in this case study was that the managerial-level people were indifferent to this behaviour as well.</p>
								<p>During the discussion, Astrid raised a very good point: We have a code of conduct which are binding for computing professionals. But how about the organisations? Wouldn’t it be more effective if such codes also covered organisational practices and safeguards as well?</p>
								<p>Indeed, at the time being, when it comes to ethics all focus seems to be on the individuals. It may be argued that, since organisations are made up of individuals, if individuals stick to the code, ethical behaviour may turn out to be a part of the organisational culture. However, as far as we can see, when there is a lack of organisational safeguards and procedures, when someone behaves inappropriately, it all comes down to whether individuals in managerial positions take responsibility for responding to this behaviour or not, and often the behaviour goes unnoticed.</p>
								<p>Therefore, in order to prevent arbitrary responses to such behaviour and to promote standardisation across countries, sectors and organisations; I firmly believe that an international code of conduct for organisations is mandatory. In my opinion, the organisation that should establish such a code of conduct and oversee it should be the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which is part of the United Nations (UN). If ILO incorporates the promotion of ethical behaviour into its Statement of Mission and Objectives (ILO, 2023) this would prove to be a huge step towards a universally binding code of ethics on an organisational level.</p>

								<h2>e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</li>
									<li>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations should be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in Unit 10.</p>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>My chosen topic: App development for emergency services</p>
								<p>I aim to explore the current status of applications developed for emergency services around the world and the direction of development efforts. So, it will be a research of an exploratory nature. I think a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods would suit well for my project: While trying to determine the utilisation level of the application in emergency departments quantitative methods would prove to be useful. However, when it comes to identifying the types of applications and areas of usage, qualitative methods will yield a better result.</p>
								<p>The survey would be my main data collection method because it helps me to gather data quickly from a large sample group. Besides, it is possible to format questionnaires in a way to gather quantitative and qualitative data at the same time. For example, I’d ask a simple yes/no question (“Do you use an application in emergency service?”) to determine the utilisation rate. I’d also ask a multiple-choice question to identify how the application is used (“Please select the areas of use of the application. Please tick all that apply.”).</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: Case Study on Privacy (Unit 4)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Please read the case below and answer the questions. You need to determine the ethical issues involved with this case.</p>
								<h4>The Case</h4>
								<p>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.</p>
								<p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.</p>
								<p>Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</p>
								<ol>
									<li>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</li>
									<li>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</li>
									<li>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</li>
									<li>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>My answer: </h3>
								<ol>
									<li>If Ricardo is not responsible for deciding who has access, he should definitely not release the names and addresses. This would be a clear violation of the subjects' privacy.</li>
									<li>In this case, I do not think it would be ethical for Ricardo to grant access to personally identifiable information until he has obtained explicit consent from each of the subjects. Because in this case he is the guardian of the privacy of the subjects' data and he should prioritise the privacy of their data above all else. Moreover, given the current legal framework, it is highly likely that some guarantees of privacy will have to be given to the subjects before their information is shared with the local government.</li>
									<li>If Beth is allowed to contact the individuals, this would still result in a breach of privacy. Because in this case the subjects will be contacted without their consent by someone who is not connected with the local government. Ethical issues related to consent and privacy should be considered by the department. </li>
									<li>In this case, Beth should not proceed with her study until she has obtained the explicit consent of half of the individuals. To avoid any privacy issues, consent should be explicitly sought and not assumed. So, she should either abandon the research or try to get the consent of the individuals that did not respond.</li>
								</ol>

								<h2>Reflective activity: Case Study - Inappropriate Use of Surveys (Unit 5)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.</p>
								<p>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.</p>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>Cambridge Analytica (CA) acquired the Facebook users through an app called 'This Is Your Digital Life' (also known as thisisyourdigitallife), which was developed in 2013 by a data scientist called Aleksandr Kogan, who worked for the University of Cambridge but was also employed by CA. CA initially applied to Facebook to conduct an academic survey of Facebook users through an informed consent process, where users would be paid to participate in the survey, but in the end Facebook allowed CA to collect data not only from survey respondents but also from their friends. The data collected from millions of Facebook users was later used to create psychological profiles of American users.</p>
								<p>Eventually, Donald Trump paid CA to obtain data on the political preferences of American voters, and his campaign team used this information to display personalised advertisements based on the user's political preferences, leading to the manipulation of voter behaviour. Earlier, US Senator Ted Cruz used this data in a similar way in his presidential campaign.</p>
								<p>If we take a closer look at how CA obtained the data from FB users, they were not the guilty party at the outset because CA sought informed consent from the users and (as far as I know) did not ask to collect the data of non-informed users. However, by allowing CA to access the data of respondents' friends, Facebook clearly violated the privacy of millions of users. So it looks like CA was trying to collect some data in a lawful and appropriate way, and when Facebook opened the doors for more, CA just took the opportunity. From that point on, CA also violated users' privacy, because even if Facebook allowed access to other users' data, that doesn't make it lawful to access that data, and CA shouldn't have collected that data knowing that it was a violation of privacy. However, it seems that CA saw how valuable the data was and wanted to take advantage of it. CA's employees should have shown more professionalism in not accessing and using the data that they should not have, and should have warned their top management about this. </p>
								<p>In summary, it is clear that both Facebook and CA violated many ethical rules, which also had legal implications. Facebook was fined by the US and UK authorities and also suffered a significant loss of prestige and trust among its users.</p>
