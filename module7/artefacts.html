								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Initial Post): Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Unit 1)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Pick a case study from the examples provided by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies">Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>. Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<p>In the case study (ACM, N.D.) in which a technical leader displayed abusive workplace behaviour towards a team member, we can see several violations of the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022).</p>
								<p>First and foremost, it is obvious that the technical leader (Max) resorts to gender-biased behaviour by removing the names of the woman researchers and contributors from the list of authors of the manuscripts submitted to the journals. His biased attitude may also be traced to his relationship with the subject of his abusive behaviour (Diana). However, according to the first principle of the BCS Code of Conduct, IT professionals should not discriminate against others based on gender. The same principle is also echoed by ACM in the Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018). In addition to the ethical implications, Max's behaviour also has some legal implications. According to the Equality Act (2010), sex is one of the protected characteristics and discriminative behaviour in the case study is evidently unlawful. </p>
								<p>The behaviour of Max also breaches the 4th pillar of the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) which stipulates that all IT professionals should be supportive of each other and encourage other professionals in their professional development. However, by putting them down and not giving them the credit they deserve for their hard work, Max obviously doesn't display supportive behaviour in this respect.</p>
								<p>However, what's even more striking to me in the case study is the organisational negligence against the obvious violations of the code of conduct. As we can see in the case study, Diana asks Jane (the team manager) for help only to find out that she took this behaviour for granted. This suggests organisational negligence towards abusive behaviour in the workplace. The managers of the organisation may think that the only way to keep the "brainchild" (Max) is to turn a blind eye on his problematic attitude, but as suggested by Tziner et al. (2023), such an approach may have far-reaching psychological, organisational and economic implications, and may eventually lead to various negative long-term consequences.</p>
								<p>All in all, I think the case study is a perfect example of how abusive behaviour prevails within an organisation when not responded to in a timely and efficient manner by the top management.</p>

								<h2>Reflective activity: Ethics in Computing (Unit 1)</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2005) Chapter 1.</p>
								<p>Your response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver and so on. </p>
								<p>In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that “many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”</p>
								<p>Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.</p>
								<h3>My response:</h3>
								<p>I considered myself as the leader of a team which is responsible to maintain the website of a media outlet and discussed some of the possible ethical issues I may face.</p>
