									<h1>Research Methods and Professional Practice</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In the first unit of the module, the focus was on research ethics, ethical codes and types of scientific research. Even though we reviewed the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) in the previous units, reviewing them within the context of scientific research, and also applying them to a case study in the formative exercise and collaborative discussion was very beneficial and illuminating. Appreciating the difference between inductive and deductive approach was the highlight of the unit for me. Even though the difference between these two seem obvious to me in theory, sometimes it is difficult to determine whether the approach in a case study is inductive or deductive. However, this unit’s reading list helped a lot to develop a better understanding of these two approaches. Finally, I chose the “App development for emergency services” topic for the literature review activity, but I am yet to determine the research questions.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Inductive reasoning</b> is the method of thinking when you start with your observations of the world and come to general conclusions about it. Inductive approaches are associated with qualitative research.</li>
									<li><b>Deductive reasoning</b> is the method of thinking when you start with your knowledge and understanding of the world and try to predict the observations within (leading to) it. Deductive approaches are commonly associated with quantitative methods.</li>
									<li><b>Qualitative methods</b> collect data via conversational methods in order to understand what participants think and why they think that way.</li>
									<li><b>Quantitative methods</b> rely on numbers and measurable forms.</li>
									<li><b>Exploratory research</b> focuses on exploring new problem areas that haven’t been explored before.</li>
									<li><b>Descriptive research</b> focuses on expanding knowledge on current issues through a process of data collection.</li>
									<li><b>Explanatory research</b> in conducted to understand the impact of specific changes in existing standard procedures (e.g. running experiments).</li>
									<li><b>Ethics</b> refer to a set of rules provides by an external organisation.</li>
									<li><b>Morals</b> refer to an individual's own principles regarding right or wrong.</li>
									<li><b>AREA 4P framework</b>: Process, Product, Purpose, People</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>The literature review is probably the most important step in any research project. Although I had a general idea of what a literature review was, the reading list in this module gave me a better understanding of the role it plays in a research project. I also got an idea of how to approach a literature review systematically. It was also interesting to see and appreciate the interplay between the research question and the literature review. Furthermore, this unit helped me to get an idea of what a research proposal should look like. Finally, a mind map seems to be a very useful tool to identify the relationship between ideas and to identify the key research question(s). I plan to use a mind map in the upcoming literature review and project proposal assignments so that I can get the hang of it before I start working on my dissertation.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Types of computing projects</b>: (1) Research-based, (2) Development, (3) Evaluation, (4) Industry-based, and (5) Problem solving.</li>
									<li><b>The areas in which a project can be original</b>: (1) Tools, techniques, procedures and methods. (2) Exploring the unknown. (3) Exploring the unanticipated. (4) The use of data.</li>
									<li>- A <b>project proposal</b> should include: (1) Title, (2) Aims and objectives, (3) Expected outcomes, deliverables, (4) Keywords, (5) Introduction/background/overview, (6) Related research, (7) Type of project, (8) Research questions and hypotheses, (9) Methods, (10) Resource requirements, and (11) Project plan.</li>
									<li><b>Aim</b> is a broad statement of project’s purpose. On the other hand, <b>objectives</b> identify specific, measurable achievements towards the ultimate aim of the project.</li>
									<li><b>Observational research</b> is a form of qualitative research technique in which researchers observe participants’ ongoing behavior in a natural situation (Shakespeare, N.D.). It works best when the researcher needs to gather sensitive information (such as religious beliefs) or behaviour in a natural setting is important for the research.</li>
									<li>Types of observational research: Controlled Observation, Naturlistic Observation, and Participant Observation.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 3: Research Methods</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In this unit, we delved deeper into the types of research methods. I found it a little bit confusing to see that there are many different classifications of research methods in different sources. Regardless of the confusion, I still found the discussion of the methods useful. The e-portfolio activity (Research Proposal Review) also provided a nice opportunity to reflect on what I learnt so far and ponder on how I would make use of different techniques. </p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Types of <b>research methods</b>: Exploratory Research and Conclusive Research. </li>
									<li><b>Exploratory Research</b> aims to explore a specific area and doesn’t aim to provide final and conclusive answers to the research question.</li>
									<li><b>Conclusive Research</b> aims to verify insights and aid in selecting a course of action/making a decision. Conclusive research can further be broken into two categories: Descriptive Research and Casual Research.</li>
									<li>Research methods can also be classified as: (1) Action research, (2) Experiment, (3) Case study, and (4) Survey.</li>
									<li><b>Action research</b> is a careful study of an attempt by the researcher to solve a problem.</li>
									<li><b>Experiment</b> involves investigation of casual relationships using tests.</li>
									<li><b>Case study</b> involves investigation of a particular situation/problem.</li>
									<li><b>Survey</b> involves collection of data through questionnaires or interviews.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week we learnt the difference between case studies and focus groups. It was also important to appreciate what needs to be considered in different types of observation. The case study which was part of the seminar preparations was a good practice which covers many aspects of GDPR. Finally, I prepared the outline of my literature review which is due in week 7 and submitted it for formative feedback.I am afraid that I may have strayed slightly from my chosen topic, so I am curious about the tutor's feedback.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>A <b>case study</b> is an in-depth study of a specific subject, group or individuals.</li>
									<li>A <b>focus group</b> is a research method in which a group of people is chosen and allowed to express their insights on the topic that is being studied. Focus groups utilize qualitative data collection methods.</li>
									<li><b>Observation</b> requires the researcher to be involved in watching, recording and analysing the events of interest.</li>
									<li><b>Naturalistic observation</b> is a type of observation in which the researcher refrains from playing a part in the study in order to prevent having an impact on the outcomes.</li>
									<li>- A researcher who adopts this approach should be aware of his/her own influence on the situation that is being observed, because the situation will no longer be under "normal" conditions since everyone involved will be aware of the researcher's presence.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Survey methods and interviews were the focal point of this unit. The discussion about the distinction between structured and unstructured interviews and when and how to use them was very useful as it also addressed the real-life issues surrounding conducting interviews (time constraints, attitude of people towards such interviews, etc.). I also appreciated the significance of pre-post analysis and its use cases.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Interview</b> provides an opportunity to obtain in-depth details from the respondent. It also allows for observation of the body language and asking follow-up questions if needed.</li>
									<li>Interviews can be undertaken in two ways: <b>Structured interviews</b> consist of a series of pre-set questions. On the other hand, unstructured interviews are more informal and involve open-ended questions. <b>Unstructured interviews</b> may reveal valuable data, but interviewee may drift away from the agenda.</li>
									<li><b>Surveys</b> should be designed in such a way that they include a right mix of open-ended and closed questions.</li>
									<li><b>Pre-post analysis</b> is a method to measure changes before and after the implementation.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 6: Questionnaire Design</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Questionnaires and question types were the main topic this week. It was important to understand the difference between a survey and a questionnaire. I was also able to identify some best practices in this week's readings. The ePortfolio and Wiki activities provided a nice opportunity to think about how I can use these different types of questions. All in all, I think this week has given me a better understanding of an important tool that I will be using during my dissertation and beyond.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Survey</b> is a comprehensive method to gather and analyze data. On the other hand, <b>questionnaire</b> is a technique that can be used to carry out a survey.</li>
									<li><b>Leading question</b> is a type of question that pushes respondents to answer in a certain way. By using these questions, a survey creator tries to confirm an already known fact instead of getting a true, unbiased answer.</li>
									<li>In order to get unbiased results, survey creator should refrain from using leading questions with biased questions, and instead, should use clear and simple questions.</li>
									<li><b><u>Best practice</u></b>: Avoid using jargon in the questions.</li>
									<li><b><u>Best practice</u></b>: In order to avoid unintended biases, survey creator can ask for help from another person who is distant from a survey topic to read the questions and comment on them.</li>
									<li><b><u>Best practice</u></b>: Always include “Prefer not to answer” option in order to reduce the dropout rate when the responders do nor feel confident to answer a question.</li>
									<li>Questions in a questionnaire should start from general to specific so that a responded can ease into the subject by thinking about their overall behaviour before delving into details.</li>
									<li>Questions should flow from one subject area to another in order to prevent revisiting a subject area that has already been covered before.</li>
									<li><b>Open-ended questions</b> are usually used to explore the behaviour, whereas <b>close-ended questions</b> are used to explore the attitudes.</li>
									<li><b>The nine steps to develop a questionnaire</b>: (1) Decide the information required. (2) Define the target respondents. (3) Choose the method(s) of reaching your target respondents. (4) Decide on question content. (5) Develop the question wording. (6) Put questions into a meaningful order and format. (7) Check the length of the questionnaire. (8) Pre-test the questionnaire. (9) Develop the final survey form.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 7: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>The distinction between reliability and validity was probably the most important takeaway from this week. This week's readings were very enlightening in terms of how to construct a qualitative design and how to select data sources. The highlight of the week was assignment 1 - I refined my research questions from the outline I had prepared and finalised my literature review. Finally, in the collaborative discussion, we had another case study where ethics plays a big role. There are a lot of 'grey' areas in the case study, so I am looking forward to hearing what my peers think about it.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Reliability</b> is the measure of the replicability of research results. It depends on the accuracy of the procedures, tools and techniques used during the research.</li>
									<li><b>Validity</b> is the measure of achievement of the original objective of the research.</li>
									<li><b>A study is externally valid</b> if it describes the true state of affairs outside its own setting.</li>
									<li><b>Population</b> is a collection of people, items or procedures that are the focus of the investigation.</li>
									<li>A <b>random sample</b> is chosen to avoid bias in the selection of the sample.</li>
									<li>A <b>stratified random sample</b> is when we ensure that the same proportion of a characteristic of interest (for example gender or age) is present in the sample as in the population.</li>
									<li>A <b>confounding variable (confounder)</b> is a factor other than the one being studied that is associated both with the dependent variable and with the factor being studied (independent variable). </li>
									<li>In qualitative research, researchers cannot formulate an hypothesis upfront. Rather, they formulate and refine the hypothesis during the process of data collection and analysis.</li>
									<li><b>Qualitative researchers</b> use three main sources for data: (1) Observation, (2) Open-ended interviews and survey questions, and (3) Documents and texts.</li>
									<li><b>Focus groups</b> offers the opportunity for those present to reach and respond to each others’ remarks.</li>
								</ul>
