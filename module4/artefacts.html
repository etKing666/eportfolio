								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1: Digitalisation – What are the security implications of the digital economy? (Unit 1):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) and then post a message that reflects your thoughts and responses to the questions below. You should support your arguments with appropriate academic references.</p>
								<p>In your responses, consider the following questions:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</li>
										<li>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</li>
										<li>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</li>
										<li>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022?</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<h4>Cybersecurity challenges of digital enterprises</h4>
								<p>From my point of view, in order to define “fully digital enterprise”, first we have to look at the definition of “digital economy”. According to Santander (2022), the term digital economy “refers to the use of information technology to create or adapt, market or consume goods and services”. Even though there are so many other ways to define the term, I find this version broad enough to be applicable to virtually every sector of economy and I think it captures the essence of it very well. Hence, I would define a fully digital enterprise as the one which utilizes the novel techniques and approaches that the latest information technologies bring in every business function, is able to transform rapidly in line with the latest advancements and, the last but not the least, embraces an organization-wide digital culture.</p>
								<p>While cutting-edge technologies offer numerous advantages for businesses (Wei et al., 2019), going digital usually means having a bigger attack surface in terms of cybersecurity. The reason is simple: The easily manageable assets of yesterday, turn into digital assets which might act as an unwanted gateways into the enterprise if managed improperly. That’s why embracing an organization-wide digital culture is important: having an expert to manage the digital assets is not enough, every single employee should be aware of the risks and act accordingly. In a nutshell, even though a fully digital enterprise is, without a doubt, much more efficient than the traditional one, it is much more vulnerable to cyber threats. </p>
								<p>The change of mindset is arguably the biggest challenge that SMEs wanting to transform into a digital enterprise. For instance, on an enterprise-level, as pointed out by Spremic and Simunic (2018), some companies still push cybersecurity to the background, delegating the “burden” of cybersecurity to the IT. Same applies to SMEs especially when there is too much competition and a pressure to market the product as soon as possible to get the upper-hand. Even more so when they lack the leadership and expertise to embrace the necessary mindset towards cybersecurity. It should also be noted that the change management is also an important aspect of the transition (Pennarola, 2022).</p>
								<p>Energy sector is one of the sectors which benefits from the latest technologies most and with the energy crisis, every asset in the energy sector became more vulnerable. As demonstrated by the latest ENISA Threat Landscape Report (ENISA, 2022) energy sector is susceptible to all kinds of cyber-attacks which includes state-sponsored cyberattacks and it is one of the most severely impacted sectors in terms of repetitional, digital and economic impact. In the light of these findings, the power companies prove to be invaluable targets and cybersecurity policies should be at the top of the agenda of these companies to mitigate the grave risks.</p>

								<h2>e-Portfolio Component: Vulnerability Analysis – Literature Review Activity? (Unit 2):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Carry out a literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with websites.</p>
								<p>I carried out a literature research on national vulnerabilities database, reputable software and research websites and came up with a shortlist of 10 vulnerabilities that is common to e-Commerce (as well as other types of) websites. You can see the list <a href="../files/M4_SAR_Step_1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
								<p>Please refer to the reflections page (under Unit 2 section) for my reflections on this activity.</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: The Solar Winds Breach Case Study (Unit 2):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read the Solar Winds article by Temple-Raston (2021) and the description of the Cyber Kill Chain model (Hutchins et al, 2011) and carry out the following activities:</p>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>Create a table that analyses the solar winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain. Are there any phases that you cannot identify?</li>
										<li>Create a list of possible mitigations for each phase. Are there any phases you cannot mitigate?</li>
										<li>What tools would you utilise in each phase? Give reasons for your answer.</li>
										<li>Create a slide deck presentation with up to 4 slides that discuss your solution. Be prepared to present it at the seminar this week.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>In my first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to the Solar Winds Breach, I wasn't able to identify Exploitation and Installation steps accurately and come up with a mitigation for each phase. In my opinion, this was also partly due to the lack of information shared in the articles that was shared for the case study. My first version of the Cyber Kill Chain model was like this:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/Solar Winds Breach Initial.png" alt="My first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">My first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach<br /></p>
								<p>However, after the carefully examining the Cyber Kill Chain model that was presented by one of my classmates during the seminar and extending my research on the Solar Winds Breach as well as the Cyber Kill Chain model, I was able to come up with a model like this:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/Solar Winds Breach Final.png" alt="My first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">My second attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach<br /></p>
								<p>Even though there might still be some room to develop the model further, I think this is an important improvement from the first attempt.</p>
