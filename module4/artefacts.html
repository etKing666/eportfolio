								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Initial Post): Digitalisation – What are the security implications of the digital economy? (Unit 1):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) and then post a message that reflects your thoughts and responses to the questions below. You should support your arguments with appropriate academic references.</p>
								<p>In your responses, consider the following questions:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</li>
										<li>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</li>
										<li>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</li>
										<li>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022?</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<h4>Cybersecurity challenges of digital enterprises</h4>
								<p>From my point of view, in order to define “fully digital enterprise”, first we have to look at the definition of “digital economy”. According to Santander (2022), the term digital economy “refers to the use of information technology to create or adapt, market or consume goods and services”. Even though there are so many other ways to define the term, I find this version broad enough to be applicable to virtually every sector of economy and I think it captures the essence of it very well. Hence, I would define a fully digital enterprise as the one which utilizes the novel techniques and approaches that the latest information technologies bring in every business function, is able to transform rapidly in line with the latest advancements and, the last but not the least, embraces an organization-wide digital culture.</p>
								<p>While cutting-edge technologies offer numerous advantages for businesses (Wei et al., 2019), going digital usually means having a bigger attack surface in terms of cybersecurity. The reason is simple: The easily manageable assets of yesterday, turn into digital assets which might act as an unwanted gateways into the enterprise if managed improperly. That’s why embracing an organization-wide digital culture is important: having an expert to manage the digital assets is not enough, every single employee should be aware of the risks and act accordingly. In a nutshell, even though a fully digital enterprise is, without a doubt, much more efficient than the traditional one, it is much more vulnerable to cyber threats. </p>
								<p>The change of mindset is arguably the biggest challenge that SMEs wanting to transform into a digital enterprise. For instance, on an enterprise-level, as pointed out by Spremic and Simunic (2018), some companies still push cybersecurity to the background, delegating the “burden” of cybersecurity to the IT. Same applies to SMEs especially when there is too much competition and a pressure to market the product as soon as possible to get the upper-hand. Even more so when they lack the leadership and expertise to embrace the necessary mindset towards cybersecurity. It should also be noted that the change management is also an important aspect of the transition (Pennarola, 2022).</p>
								<p>Energy sector is one of the sectors which benefits from the latest technologies most and with the energy crisis, every asset in the energy sector became more vulnerable. As demonstrated by the latest ENISA Threat Landscape Report (ENISA, 2022) energy sector is susceptible to all kinds of cyber-attacks which includes state-sponsored cyberattacks and it is one of the most severely impacted sectors in terms of repetitional, digital and economic impact. In the light of these findings, the power companies prove to be invaluable targets and cybersecurity policies should be at the top of the agenda of these companies to mitigate the grave risks.</p>

								<h2>e-Portfolio Component: Vulnerability Analysis – Literature Review Activity (Unit 2):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Carry out a literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with websites.</p>
								<p>I carried out a literature review on national vulnerabilities database, reputable software and research websites and came up with a shortlist of 10 vulnerabilities that is common to e-Commerce (as well as other types of) websites. You can see the list <a href="../files/M4_SAR_Step_1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
								<p>Please refer to the reflections page (under Unit 2 subsection) for my reflections on this activity.</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: The Solar Winds Breach Case Study (Unit 2):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read the Solar Winds article by Temple-Raston (2021) and the description of the Cyber Kill Chain model (Hutchins et al, 2011) and carry out the following activities:</p>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>Create a table that analyses the solar winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain. Are there any phases that you cannot identify?</li>
										<li>Create a list of possible mitigations for each phase. Are there any phases you cannot mitigate?</li>
										<li>What tools would you utilise in each phase? Give reasons for your answer.</li>
										<li>Create a slide deck presentation with up to 4 slides that discuss your solution. Be prepared to present it at the seminar this week.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>In my first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to the Solar Winds Breach, I wasn't able to identify Exploitation and Installation steps accurately and come up with a mitigation for each phase. In my opinion, this was also partly due to the lack of information shared in the articles that was shared for the case study. My first version of the Cyber Kill Chain model was like this:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/Solar Winds Breach Initial.png" alt="My first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">My first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach<br /></p>
								<p>However, after the carefully examining the Cyber Kill Chain model that was presented by one of my classmates during the seminar and extending my research on the Solar Winds Breach as well as the Cyber Kill Chain model, I was able to come up with a model like this:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/Solar Winds Breach Final.png" alt="My first attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">My second attempt to apply Cyber Kill Chain model to Solar Winds Breach<br /></p>
								<p>Even though there might still be some room to develop the model further, I think this is an important improvement from the first attempt.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Summary Post): Digitalisation – What are the security implications of the digital economy? (Unit 3):</h2>
								<p>Having read the posts from my fellow classmates and the valuable reply from James to my initial post, I wrapped up my thoughts about the topic in my summary post. You can read it below:</p>
								<h4>Cybersecurity challenges of digital enterprises (Summary post)</h4>
								<p>Even though we can define a digital enterprise in many different ways, in my opinion the most concise one, as Ola pointed out in his initial post, is the one suggested by Siemens. According to the company, a “digital Enterprise is a business that has completed a digitalization strategy to fully incorporate digital tools and technologies across all aspects of their operations, from ideation thru realization to utilization” (Siemens, 2023). Moreover, as I mentioned in my initial post, from my point of view, one of the most important aspects of digital enterprises is its ability to transform itself constantly, in line with latest technologies and challenges.</p>
								<p>Manchala (2022) also lists the seven characteristics of successful digital enterprises as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Extreme customer centricity</li>
									<li>Command over ecosystem data</li>
									<li>Connected products and services</li>
									<li>Digitalized and experience-centric operations</li>
									<li>Digitalized workplaces</li>
									<li>Cloud-enabled IT infrastructures</li>
									<li>Secure business ecosystems</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If we examine the above characteristics closely, we can easily identify the attack surface of the digital enterprises: connected products and services, digitalized workspaces, digitalized customer experience and cloud-enabled infrastructures. For a traditional SME that wants to complete its digital transformation, it might be difficult to realize and address to each of these challenges. </p>
								<p>In his reply to my initial post, James indicated a key difference between SMEs and large enterprises in the energy sector. Large energy companies have to deal with the burden of updating their legacy systems to tackle with the necessity to stay connected, however this might not always be possible due to operational constraints. I also think that these companies have to not only update their systems but also to renew them and they have to do it frequently to keep up with the latest technologies. It is no surprise that it requires a sizable investment budget which may impede the companies from taking the necessary action, increasing the cybersecurity risks.</p>
								<p>A great idea put forward by James was to introduce a mandatory cybersecurity awareness event during the company registration process and also incorporate it to the business degrees. I agree that such an event may prove useful in raising awareness of the company executives towards cybersecurity and addressing the issues suggested by Spremic and Simunic (2018) in the long run.</p>
								<p>To conclude, even though the age of digitalization and cybersecurity has been here for a long time now, many actors are still trying to find their way in the uncharted waters and fail to embrace the digital-aware mindset which, in turn, increases their exposure to cybersecurity risks.</p>

								<h2>e-Portfolio Component: Vulnerability Analysis – Scanning Activity (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as traceroute, dig and nslookup. Instructions on using traceroute, etc can be found on this website. Refer to this week's reading for further assistance. Do not use ping as it will cause confusion because of shared addresses.</p>
								<p>Use these basic tools and make a list that details the following information:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</li>
									<li>Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?</li>
									<li>What are the main nameservers for the website?</li>
									<li>Who is the registered contact?</li>
									<li>What is the MX record for the website?</li>
									<li>Where is the website hosted?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Following the literature review I carried out last week, I used the tools mentioned in the instructions (and some more) to find the answers to the questions given. Here are my <a href="../files/M4_SAR_Step_2.pdf">results</a>.</p>
								<p>Please refer to the reflections page (under Unit 3 subsection) for my reflections on this activity.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Assignment 1: Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> You have been tasked by an organisation to evaluate their website (provided in Unit 1) and produce an analysis document. It should consist of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Details of possible security vulnerabilities.</li>
									<li>A list of standards appropriate to their business and any non-compliance against those standards.</li>
									<li>A summary of recommendations and potential mitigations that could be used to ameliorate any risks. These should be ordered by importance.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For this first assessment, you will need to produce an analysis document that promotes the benefit of what you will be doing for the business and sets a baseline for the subsequent scans to be evaluated against.</p>
								<p>I carried out a literature review in order to find out the potential vulnerabilities of websites/web applications in general and e-commerce websites in particular and listed the potential vulnerabilities in the order of importance. I selected Cyber Kill Chain as the analysis model. I have also included the standards and regulations that I would compare the website against, the tools I would be using, as well as the business implications, limitations and assumptions.</p>
								<p>You can see the Baseline Analysis and Plan document <a href="../files/M4U3 Vulnerability Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan.pdf">here</a>.</p>

								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2 (Initial Post): The Pros and cons of logging – The impact of log4j (Unit 4):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Berger (2021) and Ekelhart et al (2019) and then post your thoughts on the issues of logging for security analysis versus the issues of log-related exploits. You should support your arguments with appropriate academic references.</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<h4>To log or not to log</h4>
								<p>To begin with, I’d like to highlight that from my point of view, having unstructured logs and the security of the logs are two different discussion points.</p>
								<p>As pointed out by Ekelhart et al (2019), in case the logs are a huge chunk of unstructured data in which you have to spend considerable amount of time to make sense of it, logging might seem like a useless practice. However, in fact, it is an invaluable tool to record all that is happening in a system, track system performance and hunt for errors when something goes wrong. For the majority of cases, it is also a legal obligation to keep logs (ICO, N.D.) It also helps to track and find the criminals in case of an attack. I’d say it is the X-ray of the system and too valuable too ignore. Of course, this characteristic of logs make it an attractive target for attackers and these attacks may come in a variety of forms like log injection (OWASP, N.D.) or more specific ones like log4j (Berger, 2021)</p>
								<p>So, it is clear that ways to secure and organize logs have to be devised and implemented so that the system administrators may continue rising the benefits of having each activity by system users and components recored with the peace of mind knowing that their log is not vulnerable for attacks.</p>
								<p>In my opinion, a great example of secure and functional logging is implemented in Amazon Web Services. AWS CloudWatch (AWS, 2023a) allows system administrators to keep a record of user activity and API call and store them in secure S3 buckets in which the data is secured at rest and also in transit. In terms of practicality, an authorized user can easily run queries in the logs using AWS CloudTrail (AWS, 2023b).</p>
								<p>To conclude, I think secure and practical logging is possible and it should be the goal in order to design a resilient and accountable systems.</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: Breach Analysis Case Study (Unit 4):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Swinhoe, D. (2020), The 15 Biggest Data Breaches of the 21st Century.</p>
								<p>Select one of the cases quoted and then complete a breach checklist as discussed in the required reading (reproduced below):</p>
								<ul>
									<li>What types of data were affected?</li>
									<li>What happened?</li>
									<li>Who was responsible?</li>
									<li>Were any escalation(s) stopped - how?</li>
									<li>Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?</li>
									<li>Was the ICO notified?</li>
									<li>Were affected individuals notified?</li>
									<li>What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you had been the ISM for the organisation you selected, what mitigations would you have put in place to stop any reoccurrences?</p>
								<p>I selected 2013 Yahoo breach and prepared a slide to answer the questions above:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/2013 Yahoo Breach.png" alt="2013 Yahoo breach analysis" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">2013 Yahoo Breach Analysis<br /></p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Case Study: Reviewing an Assessment Reporting Template (Unit 5):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> You are tasked with reviewing <a href="https://purplesec.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sample-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report-PurpleSec.pdf">the assessment template from PurpleSec.</a></p>
								<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Does this template meet the NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use as a reference point for pen tests? If not what changes/amendments would you make?</li>
									<li>What are the two best lessons/examples presented in the report?</li>
									<li>What two things do you think are unnecessary or could be done more effectively?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>According to NCSC (2022), a pen test report should include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Any security issues uncovered</li>
									<li>An assessment by the test team as to the level of risk that each vulnerability exposes the organisation or system to</li>
									<li>A method of resolving each issue found</li>
									<li>An opinion on the accuracy of your organisation's vulnerability assessment</li>
									<li>Advice on how to improve your internal vulnerability assessment process</li>
								</ul>
								<p>When the sample report is analysed, we can easily see that all security issues identified by the test team have been listed and categorized according to the level of severity. Also, a recommendation to mitigate the risks posed by these issues are also included. However, it lacks a discussion about the accuracy of the organisation’s vulnerability assessment as well as the suggested improvements. So, I had the chance to revise this report, I would add a part to discuss how the assessment results compared against the organization’s own assessment and how to improve the organization’s internal assessment process. Even though it is not listed in the NCSC’s list o requirements, a section which discusses the compliance of the assessed system against industry standards may also come in handy.</p>
								<p>I think one of the strongest aspects of this report is that it is written in a non-technical manner so that all stakeholders (including C-level executives) can understand the findings and the recommendations. The executive summary sums up the report in a concise manner. Another good example is the manner which recommendations for security policy and configuration is presented. The policy setting, description and recommendation is laid out exquisitely so that it is easy to understand and implement. Another point worth mentioning is that the report points out to the systems that were excluded from the scans due to potential negative business impact.</p>
								<p>When it comes to the downsides of the report, I think the detailed list of vulnerabilities, which may include some technical details that most of the readers of the report may not be familiar with, should not be included in main body of the report. It should be appended to the report as an appendix to make the report more readable. Another point is that as far as we understand from the report, the assessment lacks a clear and widely-accepted methodology. So, the methodology section should have been more informative and descriptive and should include a widely used methodology in order to make it more useful for the IT professionals of the organisation.</p>
								<p>Please refer to the reflections page (under Unit 5 subsection) for my reflections on this activity.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Assignment 2: Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive Summary (Unit 6):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Following your analysis document that you submitted in Unit 3, you should now produce an executive summary that pulls together your findings, recommendations and conclusions in a clear and unambiguous format. It should consist of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A brief summary of the work carried out.</li>
									<li>Summary findings – presented in an easy to understand, non-technical manner (supported by graphics and charts as appropriate).</li>
									<li>A section that evaluates the website against two security standards – one of which must be the GDPR directive.</li>
									<li>Conclusions – with justifications.</li>
									<li>Recommendations – with justifications, ordered by business priority.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Based on the scans and the research I carried out, I have prepared the Executive Summary section which summarizes the work I carried out and my findings as well as the conclusions and recommendations. I also compared the website against UK GDPR (Data Protection Act, 2018) and PCI DSS (PCI SSC, 2022) .</p>
