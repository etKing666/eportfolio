									<h1>MSc Computing Project</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Your Dissertation</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In the opening unit of the project module, I had the opportunity to revisit some important topics such as writing the project report and presenting a project. I also learnt some new concepts like "carving a research space" or how to set "SMART objectives" and "consider PALL" when preparing a presentation. Most importantly, since the supervisor request form is due next week, I reached out to two of my potential supervisors to get their approval to supervise my project.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Key elements of a dissertation: (1) Research question, (2) Aims and objectives, (3) Project plan, (4) Literature review, (5) Implementation and experimentation, and (6) Evaluation.</li>
									<li>The <b>aim</b> is the overarching goal of the dissertation. On the other hand, <b>objectives</b> define steps or actions that support delivering that aim.</li>
									<li>Objectives should be <b>SMART</b>: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time Constrained.</li>
									<li><b>Primary research</b> aims to collect original data for a specific research problem and then analyze and report the findings.</li>
									<li><b>Secondary research</b> is the one in which you rely on secondary sources for data, such as a literature review.</li>
									<li>Three different methods for <b>“carving a research space”</b> (CARS): (1) Counter-claiming, (2) Indicating a gap, and (3) Question-raising.</li>
									<li>A <b>research question</b> should satisfy the following criteria: (1) Focused, (2) Researchable, (3) Feasible, (4) Specific, (5) Complex, and (6) Relevant.</li>
									<li>When preparing a presentation, you should consider <b>PALL</b>: (1) Purpose, (2) Audience, (3) Language, and (4) Layout. </li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Project Planning and Risks</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Realistic planning and procrastination are the most important concepts that appeared in this unit. Indeed, these two seem to be the biggest showstoppers for a project, so one has to be careful about these. Furthermore, thanks to this week’s lecturecast, I decided to track my project’s progress using a Kanban board. Until now, I was thinking about tracking it using a Gantt chart, but as it is much more flexible, it seems like a Kanban board is much more suitable. I will still have a Gantt chart but it will only complement the Kanban board and demonstrate my initial plan.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>A <b>work package</b> is a collection of related tasks that form a manageable chunk of a project.</li>
									<li><b>Plan-driven approach</b> is more of a traditional approach to project management in which a plan is created and then, the plan is delivered.</li>
									<li><b>Agile</b> is focused on breaking your work down into small manageable chunks that deliver key functionality early and often.</li>
									<li>As a rule of thumb, only 10% of total project time should be spent on project management tasks.</li>
									<li>The four main stages of this <b>risk management</b> process are: (1) Identify risks, (2) Assess impact of risks, (3) Alleviate critical risks, (4) Control risks.</li>
									<li><b>Risk impact</b> = likelihood x consequence</li>
									<li><b>Three ways to deal with risks</b>: (1) Avoidance, (2) Transfer and (3) Contingency.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 3: Project Types and Research Methods</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week we had the opportunity to look at the types of projects and research methods. I believe that my project (A non-technical threat modelling framework and a web-based threat modelling tool for micro businesses) falls somewhere between a software development project and an empirical research project. In addition, as I also indicated in this week's formative activity, qualitative research is more appropriate for my project as I intend to explore how threat modelling is handled in micro businesses and then design a threat modelling framework and a threat modelling tool based on my findings.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Three different kinds of projects: (1) Software development, (2) Empirical research, and (3) Analytical project.</li>
									<li>Four steps for a successful survey: (1) <b>Determine</b> who will participate in the survey, (2) <b>Design</b> the survey questions, (3) <b>Distribute</b> the survey, and (4) <b>Analyse</b> the data.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Reviewing Literature</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>As suggested in this week's lecturecast, the literature review will take up a significant proportion of the total word count. Whilst it demonstrates a deeper understanding of the subject area, I fear that it may cause me to be more conservative in other chapters. Nevertheless, it is an important part of the final dissertation as it will help me to contextualise my research. So I will have to strike a balance between doing a thorough literature review and leaving enough space for the other components.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The <b>lifecycle of literature review</b>: (1) Early review, (2) Literature review, (3) Final dissertation.</li>
									<li><b>Types of literature review</b>: (1) Narrative, (2) Descriptive, (3) Scoping, (4) Theoretical, (5) Systematic, (6) Critical.</li>
									<li>Five criteria that can be used to evaluate a source: (1) Relevance, (2) Objectivity, (3) Accuracy, (4) Timeliness, (5) Usability.</li>
									<li>The criteria to use to bound a literature review: (1) Inclusion criteria, (2) Exclusion criteria, (3) Language, (4) Search platform, (5) Type of literature, (6) Date, (7) Cited by criteria.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 5: Research Ethics</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week's lecturecast and reading list focused on ethical issues, which is obviously a very important topic for my dissertation. Meanwhile, this week I prepared the questionnaires I plan to use during my research and submitted them to my supervisors for feedback. I tried to add the necessary informative content to obtain informed consent from the participants, which was in line with the content of this week's lecture.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>The Menlo Report</b> is an ethical framework, which provides a set of basic principles to guide the identification and resolution of ethical problems relating to information and communication technology.</li>
									<li>The core principles of Menlo Report are: (1) Respect for Persons, (2) Beneficence, (3) Justice, and (4) Respect for the Law and Public Interest.</li>
								</ul>
