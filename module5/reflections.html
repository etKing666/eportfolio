									<h1>Information Security Management</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								</p>
								<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Coming from the Network Security module, I feel more comfortable when starting this module than the previous one. This week I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of information security management. I especially found the Risk Management Guide by the Stoneburner et al. (2002) especially useful as it includes useful information about the steps of risk management including the expected outcome of each step. It also includes a sample risk assessment report outline, which will prove useful for the first assignment. </p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The main concepts of Information Security Management are <b>CIA: (1) Confidentiality, (2) Integrity, (3) Availability</b>. Many sources also add <b>Non-repudiation</b> to that list. The definitions can be found in ISO/IEC 27000:2012.</li>
									<li>PDCA mandate: <b>plan, do, check and act</b>.</li>
									<li>Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset</li>
									<li><b>Open FAIR</b> (Factor Analysis Information Risk) consists of two documents: O-RT (Open Risk Taxonomy) and O-RA (Open Risk Analysis). </li>
									<li><b>Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) framework</b> is a mix of 3 different programs: Information Security Evaluation (ISE), CMU's Software Engineering Institute (SEI), and Information Security Risk Management (ISRM).</li>
									<li>Three phases of OCTAVE: <b>(1) Build enterprise-wide security requirements, (2) Identify infrastructure vulnerabilities, and (3) Determine security risk management strategy</b>. </li>
									<li>Risk management includes three phases: <b>(1) Risk assessment, (2) Risk mitigation, and (3) Evaluation and assessment</b>.</li>
									<li>Risk management allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data.</li>
									<li>Risk management is an iterative process which should be performed during each major phase of SDLC.</li>
									<li>Risk assessment is a nine-step process:<br />
										<ol>
											<li>System Characterization</li>
											<li>Threat Identification</li>
											<li>Vulnerability Identification</li>
											<li>Control Analysis</li>
											<li>Likelihood Determination</li>
											<li>Impact Analysis</li>
											<li>Risk Determination</li>
											<li>Control Recommendations</li>
											<li>Results Documentation</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li><b>A threat-source</b> is a circumstance or an event with the potential to cause harm to an IT system.</li>
									<li>Risk mitigation options are:<br />
										<ul>
											<li>Risk Assumption</li>
											<li>Risk Avoidance</li>
											<li>Risk Limitation</li>
											<li>Risk Planning</li>
											<li>Research and Acknowledgement</li>
											<li>Risk Transference</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>Residual risk</b> is the risk remaining after the implementation of new or enhanced controls.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Threat Modelling Exercises</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In the 2nd unit of the module, I had the opportunity to get a practical experience in threat modeling. I chose to model potential threats for a large international bank based in the UK. I came up with a basic data flow diagram first and then applied STRIDE model. I also tried to use MITRE ATT&CK libraries to populate the model, but since the library was extensive, sometimes I ended up relying on my own knowledge and experience. I had the opportunity to present my model to the tutor and he advised me to also incorporate DREAD model to it. Even though I had a hard time understanding how to use DREAD until this week, this week’s seminar proved very handy as it included useful information and tangible examples about DREAD model.</p>
								<p>I also found this week’s reading very useful, even more so as I started to work on the first assignment. Most importantly: Core book (Shostack, 2014) had an insightful chapter on attack trees and I intend to use it in my future threat models. Airmic’s booklet about Enterprise Risk Management (Airmic, 2010) contains some useful information about the basic concepts of risk management. I also gained insight about FAIR model (including concepts like Loss Event Frequency and Loss Magnitude) and the opportunities and challenges that the digitalization brings towards a more sustainable future.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Logging reduces the risk of repudiation.</li>
									<li><b>Attack trees</b> are a way of describing the security of systems, representing attack against a system in a tree structure, with the goal as the root node and different ways of achieving that goal as leaf nodes.</li>
									<li>The attack trees can be OR trees or AND trees.</li>
									<li>In an attack tree, marking nodes that have been mitigated helps people see that the attacks were considered.</li>
									<li>Risks are typically broken into <b>tactical, operational</b> and <b>strategic risks</b>.</li>
									<li>According to ISO (2009), risk is the “effect of uncertainty on objectives”.</li>
									<li><b>Risk assessment</b> involves identification of risks followed by their evaluation or ranking. </li>
									<li><b>Risk ranking</b> can be quantitative, semi-quantitative or qualitative</li>
									<li>7Rs and 4Ts of risk management:
										<ul>
											<li>    Recognition or identification of risks</li>
											<li>    Ranking or evaluation of risks</li>
											<li>    Responding to significant risks
												<ul>
													<li>    Tolerate</li>
													<li>    Treat</li>
													<li>    Transfer</li>
													<li>    Terminate</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>    Resourcing controls</li>
											<li>    Reaction planning </li>
											<li>    Reporting and monitoring risk performance</li>
											<li>    Reviewing the risk management framework </li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>According to <b>FAIR</b> model, risk (financial lost) is defined by <b>Loss Event Frequency (LEF)</b> and <b>Loss Magnitude (LM)</b>.</li>
									<li><b>Loss Event Frequency</b> is the frequency that a threat agent will inflict harm on an information asset within a given timeframe.</li>
									<li><b>Loss Magnitude</b> is categorized as either a Primary Loss (PL) or Secondary Loss (SL). </li>
									<li>Primary Loss represents the direct losses from assets and threats whilst Secondary Loss represents secondary consequential losses such as negative organizational and external environment after effects.<u>Secondary loss events can occur only if primary loss events have occurred beforehand</u>.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>My focus this week was to finish the first assignment which included a risk assessment of a small business that wants to undergo a digital transformation. Even though there were a number of business-oriented approaches out there (e.g., PASTA), I came to a conclusion that these approaches were too complex and inappropriate for such a small business. In the end, I decided to use a custom 5-step approach which included STRIDE and DREAD together to identify all the risks in a quantitative manner and also used MITRE ATT&CK library to come identify possible threats and mitigations. I think this was a great exercise on enumerating threats and using he MITRE ATT&CK library which is extensive and informative at the same time. However, the real challenge was to incorporate the business objectives to the risk assessment process. During the. assessment I identified the explicit and implied business objectives and mapped them to the threats identified. This allowed me to see the impact the threats could make on the business objectives. </p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Any successful attack has three steps: (1) Diagnose the system to identify some attack, (2) Gain the necessary access, and (3) Execute the attack. Defenders has an advantage: To protect a system, blocking only one of these steps will be enough. However, blocking a step in multiple ways or blocking multiple steps will be more efficient (I.e. defense in depth).</li>
									<li>Assets can always be a target of an attack throughout the SDLC, so, <b>entire life cycle should ve secured</b>.</li>
									<li>In order to get the best result out of threat modeling, <b>it should be performed early in the development cycle</b>. It will be far costlier to fix an issue identified later on.</li>
									<li><b>LINDDUN (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-Repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of Information, Unawareness, Non-Compliance)</b> is a 6-step threat modeling method which focuses  on privacy concerns.</li>
									<li><b>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</b> is a numerical scoring system which reflects the severity of a vulnerability and it is often used in combination with other modeling methods. The downside of CVSS is that the scoring algorithm is somewhat vague.</li>
									<li><b>Persona non Grata (PnG)</b> focuses on the motivations and skills of human attackers and relies on archetypes of users/attackers. It is easy to adopt, but usually detects only certain threat types.</li>
									<li><b>Security Cards</b> is a brainstorming technique which helps analysts to identify unusal and complex attacks with a deck of cards.</li>
									<li><b>Hybrid Threat Modeling Method (hTMM)</b> consists of a combination of SQUARE (Security Quality Requirements Engineering Method), Security Cards, and PnG activities. </li>
									<li><b>Quantitative Threat Modeling Method</b> brings the Attack Trees, STRIDE, and CVSS methods together. It consists of building attack trees for each threat categories of STRIDE and then CVSS scores are applied for each component in the tree.</li>
									<li>The <b>Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)</b> focuses on assessing organizational risks rather than technological risks. It is a 3-step method which is created for large organizations.</li>
									<li>The Microsoft Threat Modelling process consists of 6 steps:
										<ul>
											<li>    1. Identify assets</li>
											<li>    2. Create an architecture overview</li>
											<li>    3. Decompose the application</li>
											<li>    4. Identify the threats</li>
											<li>    5. Document the threats</li>
											<li>    6. Rate the threats</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Security Standards, Frameworks and Disaster Recovery</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week I especially found the discussion about CVSS scoring system (Spring et al., 2021) quite interesting. I think CVSS scoring system is a highly subjective one which can change according the the experience level and perception of each person, so it is pretty challenging to keep the consistency. Besides, as the authors point out, some organizations might have different priorities, therefore the standard equal weighting might not be useful for them. For example, for a cloud business, availability might be more important, whereas for a banking institution, the most important aspect might be integrity.</p>
								<p>The reading list, the seminar (which took place earlier to to tight schedule) and the optional activities prove very useful to develop a better understanding of the basic concepts of disaster recovery, available options, and the disaster recovery planning.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</b> defines the time to recover IT infrastructure in case of a disaster. </li>
									<li><b>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</b> defines the maximum amount of data that a business can afford to lose.</li>
									<li>An optimal <b>disaster recovery planning</b> should take (1) initial cost, (2) cost of data transfers, (3) cost of data storage, (4) software licensing fees, (5) organizations’s data needs, and (6) organization’s disaster recovery objectives.</li>
									<li>Geographical separation of primary and backup sites is an important concept in a DRP.</li>
									<li><b>Failover</b> is what happens when switched from the failed primary to secondary.</li>
									<li><b>Failback</b> is what happens when the switch is made back from secondary to primary.</li>
									<li><b>Access management in cloud</b> requires three capabilities: (1) Ability tı identify and authenticate users, (2) the ability to assign users access rights, and (3) the ability to create and enforce access control policies for resources.</li>
									<li>Initial root account provided by cloud service providers (CSP) shouldn’t be used for routine tasks as compromising this account can give root access to the attacker. <b><u>Best practice</u></b>: Use root account only for creating users and roles.</li>
									<li>MFA should be used to reduce the likelihood of credential compromise.</li>
									<li><u><b>Best practice</b></u>: <b>Bastion hosts</b> can be used to further secure the privileged user access to the operating systems an applications running in cloud. Bastion host determines which apps and systems a privileged user can access an what operations the privileged users can perform on these resources.</li>
									<li>If the encryption keys are managed by the customer (instead of default key management system -KMS- offered by the CSP), the keys should never be stored in the cloud.</li>
									<li>IT security framework is “a series of documented processes that define policies and procedures around the implementation and ongoing management of information security controls” (Kirvan & Granneman, 2021).</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Unit 5: Future Trends in Security and Risk Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Security and Risk Management is a constantly evolving topic and as the organizations become more aware of the risks to their business and potential ways to mitigate them, novel ways to manage the risk emerge. This week’s reading list included many interesting articles about the future trends in the area of security and risk management such as Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), DevSecOps, and the application of Machine Learning (ML) to security management.</p>
								<p>This week I continued to work on the assignment 2 and I almost finished writing the code. Firstly, I coded the necessary functions as per the assignment requirements, then I applied a CLI script for an easier interaction with the user. The challenging part for me was to cover each possible failure scenario (e.g. invalid user input, invalid data, no .json file loaded, etc.) to make sure that the application fails safely. In the final week, I will work on the readme file as well as the executive summary itself.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul><b>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</b> is “the process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the activities of an organization to minimize the deleterious effects of risk on its capital and earnings” (Shackleford, 2021).</ul>
								<ul>Challenges that companies trying to implant ERM include misconceptions, implementation challenges, corporate governance, and external challenges.</ul>
								<ul>The best practices for successful implementation of ERM rely on conversations and prioritization. </ul>
								<ul>As a minimum, an <b>ERM policy</b> should include the general principles and define the accountabilities of key persons (such as CEO, CRO and the board). </ul>
								<ul><b>ERM framework</b> is the procedure manual for how ERM will be conducted and it can be based on an existing framework like ISO 31000 and can be customized to suit the organization.</ul>
								<ul>According to ISO, risk criteria is the terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated.</ul>
								<ul><b>DevSecOps</b> is the integration of security into DevOps.</ul>
