									<h1>Information Security Management</h1>
									<p>My reflections on the units included within the module.</p>
								</header>
								<section style="border:black; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">
									<h2 style="text-align:center;">Module reflections</h2>
									<p><b>What?</b></p>
									<p>As I had just finished Network Security module, I was quite knowledgeable about the threat modelling frameworks like STRIDE (Microsoft, 2022) or DREAD (Microsoft, 2023) before starting this module. However, I did not really have an opportunity to have a real threat modelling experience. Besides, even though I knew about the MITRE ATT&CK library (MITRE, 2022), it seemed so extensive to me, and I did not know how to find my way around the library and use it.</p>
									<p>Even though I had a general idea about what Disaster Recovery (DR) is, I was not familiar with the possible DR solutions and how I could design one.</p>
									<p>At the beginning of the module, I felt uneasy about the second assignment which involved developing a Python application which accepts a. json, .xml or .yaml file and convert it to an attack tree, because it had been months since I developed something using Python and I was not sure how I would visualise an attack tree.</p>
									<p><b>So what?</b></p>
									<p>This module, I felt like I really started to get my feet wet with threat modelling. In my opinion, the module content was very well structured to walk a student through the basics of threat modelling from simple exercises towards more complex assignments. To begin with, the reading about different threat modelling methodologies (Shevchenko et al., 2018) helped me to get an overview of the available methods. I found the work of Shostack (2014) and his step-by-step instructions very practical and easy to understand. After a couple of <a href="artefacts.html">small assignments</a> in the form of formative exercises or seminar preparations; I put everything together in the <a href="https://etking666.github.io/eportfolio/files/M5U3_Risk Identification Report v1.1.pdf">second assignment</a> by actually using what I learnt by enumerating threats using STRIDE, DREAD and MITRE ATT&CK library, suggesting mitigations and linking all of these with business objectives. This was a significant achievement for me, especially considering my rudimentary level of knowledge and experience at the beginning. In the second assignment, I extended the assessment by developing an <a href="https://github.com/etKing666/attack_tree">attack tree generator application</a> and generating an attack tree to demonstrate the threat model of the business before and after digitalisation. All in all, it was a fulfilling and satisfying journey for me, and I feel much more confident in threat modelling now.</p>
									<p>From my point of view, the most important takeaway from the second assignment was that writing testable code is something that I have to keep in my mind from the very beginning. When I found out that it was not easy to write unit tests due to my unique way of developing the application (i.e., using global variables instead of passing variables or skipping ‘return’ statements because a return value was not really needed), I discovered the true value of the Test-Driven Development (Beck, 2002). Even if I did not fully implement the methodology, if I aimed at writing testable code at the beginning, I think that I would end up writing a more elegant code.</p>
									<p>Additionally, the formative activities in Unit 4 helped me to discover the DR solutions such as cold standby, hot standby and warm standby and the role the cloud technologies play in DR (Alhazmi & Malaiya, 2013). It also helped me to contemplate about the advantages and disadvantages of each option. I eventually managed to <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFeb2PkZS8/g54L0zm_Msy4FFLjxcyMwQ/edit?utm_content=DAFeb2PkZS8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">design a DR solution</a> for three different sets of requirements. This was a huge step forward for me, and I was delighted to see that I was able to appreciate different DR options and even design a solution.</p>
									<p><b>Now what?</b></p>
									<p>As my tutor recommended in his feedback to my first assignment, PASTA (UcedaVelez & Morana, 2015) is much more relevant for risk assessment of a business since it allows for easier alignment to business goals. Even though I felt like it was too comprehensive for the business in question, and we had a strict wordcount limit, after giving it a good thought, I was convinced that it would be the right decision to use this framework for such cases. So, in the future, I intend to read more about PASTA and explore the opportunities to use it.</p>
									<p>Learning how to use MITRE ATT&CK library for enumerating threats and determining the mitigations was one of the biggest achievements of this module. Moving forward, in my future threat modelling practices, I will try to stick to the extensive and well-documented library provided so that the model is more aligned to the industry. </p>
									<p>Finally, drawing on from my experience with developing the Attack Tree Generator application, I will certainly try to incorporate Test-Driven Development practices to my coding practices so that I can get the habit of writing testable software.</p>

								<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Coming from the Network Security module, I feel more comfortable when starting this module than the previous one. This week I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of information security management. I especially found the Risk Management Guide by the Stoneburner et al. (2002) especially useful as it includes useful information about the steps of risk management including the expected outcome of each step. It also includes a sample risk assessment report outline, which will prove useful for the first assignment. </p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The main concepts of Information Security Management are <b>CIA: (1) Confidentiality, (2) Integrity, (3) Availability</b>. Many sources also add <b>Non-repudiation</b> to that list. The definitions can be found in ISO/IEC 27000:2012.</li>
									<li>PDCA mandate: <b>plan, do, check and act</b>.</li>
									<li>Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset</li>
									<li><b>Open FAIR</b> (Factor Analysis Information Risk) consists of two documents: O-RT (Open Risk Taxonomy) and O-RA (Open Risk Analysis). </li>
									<li><b>Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) framework</b> is a mix of 3 different programs: Information Security Evaluation (ISE), CMU's Software Engineering Institute (SEI), and Information Security Risk Management (ISRM).</li>
									<li>Three phases of OCTAVE: <b>(1) Build enterprise-wide security requirements, (2) Identify infrastructure vulnerabilities, and (3) Determine security risk management strategy</b>. </li>
									<li>Risk management includes three phases: <b>(1) Risk assessment, (2) Risk mitigation, and (3) Evaluation and assessment</b>.</li>
									<li>Risk management allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data.</li>
									<li>Risk management is an iterative process which should be performed during each major phase of SDLC.</li>
									<li>Risk assessment is a nine-step process:<br />
										<ol>
											<li>System Characterization</li>
											<li>Threat Identification</li>
											<li>Vulnerability Identification</li>
											<li>Control Analysis</li>
											<li>Likelihood Determination</li>
											<li>Impact Analysis</li>
											<li>Risk Determination</li>
											<li>Control Recommendations</li>
											<li>Results Documentation</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li><b>A threat-source</b> is a circumstance or an event with the potential to cause harm to an IT system.</li>
									<li>Risk mitigation options are:<br />
										<ul>
											<li>Risk Assumption</li>
											<li>Risk Avoidance</li>
											<li>Risk Limitation</li>
											<li>Risk Planning</li>
											<li>Research and Acknowledgement</li>
											<li>Risk Transference</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>Residual risk</b> is the risk remaining after the implementation of new or enhanced controls.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 2: Threat Modelling Exercises</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>In the 2nd unit of the module, I had the opportunity to get a practical experience in threat modeling. I chose to model potential threats for a large international bank based in the UK. I came up with a basic data flow diagram first and then applied STRIDE model. I also tried to use MITRE ATT&CK libraries to populate the model, but since the library was extensive, sometimes I ended up relying on my own knowledge and experience. I had the opportunity to present my model to the tutor and he advised me to also incorporate DREAD model to it. Even though I had a hard time understanding how to use DREAD until this week, this week’s seminar proved very handy as it included useful information and tangible examples about DREAD model.</p>
								<p>I also found this week’s reading very useful, even more so as I started to work on the first assignment. Most importantly: Core book (Shostack, 2014) had an insightful chapter on attack trees and I intend to use it in my future threat models. Airmic’s booklet about Enterprise Risk Management (Airmic, 2010) contains some useful information about the basic concepts of risk management. I also gained insight about FAIR model (including concepts like Loss Event Frequency and Loss Magnitude) and the opportunities and challenges that the digitalization brings towards a more sustainable future.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Logging reduces the risk of repudiation.</li>
									<li><b>Attack trees</b> are a way of describing the security of systems, representing attack against a system in a tree structure, with the goal as the root node and different ways of achieving that goal as leaf nodes.</li>
									<li>The attack trees can be OR trees or AND trees.</li>
									<li>In an attack tree, marking nodes that have been mitigated helps people see that the attacks were considered.</li>
									<li>Risks are typically broken into <b>tactical, operational</b> and <b>strategic risks</b>.</li>
									<li>According to ISO (2009), risk is the “effect of uncertainty on objectives”.</li>
									<li><b>Risk assessment</b> involves identification of risks followed by their evaluation or ranking. </li>
									<li><b>Risk ranking</b> can be quantitative, semi-quantitative or qualitative</li>
									<li>7Rs and 4Ts of risk management:
										<ul>
											<li>    Recognition or identification of risks</li>
											<li>    Ranking or evaluation of risks</li>
											<li>    Responding to significant risks
												<ul>
													<li>    Tolerate</li>
													<li>    Treat</li>
													<li>    Transfer</li>
													<li>    Terminate</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>    Resourcing controls</li>
											<li>    Reaction planning </li>
											<li>    Reporting and monitoring risk performance</li>
											<li>    Reviewing the risk management framework </li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>According to <b>FAIR</b> model, risk (financial lost) is defined by <b>Loss Event Frequency (LEF)</b> and <b>Loss Magnitude (LM)</b>.</li>
									<li><b>Loss Event Frequency</b> is the frequency that a threat agent will inflict harm on an information asset within a given timeframe.</li>
									<li><b>Loss Magnitude</b> is categorized as either a Primary Loss (PL) or Secondary Loss (SL). </li>
									<li>Primary Loss represents the direct losses from assets and threats whilst Secondary Loss represents secondary consequential losses such as negative organizational and external environment after effects.<u>Secondary loss events can occur only if primary loss events have occurred beforehand</u>.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>My focus this week was to finish the first assignment which included a risk assessment of a small business that wants to undergo a digital transformation. Even though there were a number of business-oriented approaches out there (e.g., PASTA), I came to a conclusion that these approaches were too complex and inappropriate for such a small business. In the end, I decided to use a custom 5-step approach which included STRIDE and DREAD together to identify all the risks in a quantitative manner and also used MITRE ATT&CK library to come identify possible threats and mitigations. I think this was a great exercise on enumerating threats and using he MITRE ATT&CK library which is extensive and informative at the same time. However, the real challenge was to incorporate the business objectives to the risk assessment process. During the. assessment I identified the explicit and implied business objectives and mapped them to the threats identified. This allowed me to see the impact the threats could make on the business objectives. </p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Any successful attack has three steps: (1) Diagnose the system to identify some attack, (2) Gain the necessary access, and (3) Execute the attack. Defenders has an advantage: To protect a system, blocking only one of these steps will be enough. However, blocking a step in multiple ways or blocking multiple steps will be more efficient (I.e. defense in depth).</li>
									<li>Assets can always be a target of an attack throughout the SDLC, so, <b>entire life cycle should ve secured</b>.</li>
									<li>In order to get the best result out of threat modeling, <b>it should be performed early in the development cycle</b>. It will be far costlier to fix an issue identified later on.</li>
									<li><b>LINDDUN (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-Repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of Information, Unawareness, Non-Compliance)</b> is a 6-step threat modeling method which focuses  on privacy concerns.</li>
									<li><b>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</b> is a numerical scoring system which reflects the severity of a vulnerability and it is often used in combination with other modeling methods. The downside of CVSS is that the scoring algorithm is somewhat vague.</li>
									<li><b>Persona non Grata (PnG)</b> focuses on the motivations and skills of human attackers and relies on archetypes of users/attackers. It is easy to adopt, but usually detects only certain threat types.</li>
									<li><b>Security Cards</b> is a brainstorming technique which helps analysts to identify unusal and complex attacks with a deck of cards.</li>
									<li><b>Hybrid Threat Modeling Method (hTMM)</b> consists of a combination of SQUARE (Security Quality Requirements Engineering Method), Security Cards, and PnG activities. </li>
									<li><b>Quantitative Threat Modeling Method</b> brings the Attack Trees, STRIDE, and CVSS methods together. It consists of building attack trees for each threat categories of STRIDE and then CVSS scores are applied for each component in the tree.</li>
									<li>The <b>Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)</b> focuses on assessing organizational risks rather than technological risks. It is a 3-step method which is created for large organizations.</li>
									<li>The Microsoft Threat Modelling process consists of 6 steps:
										<ul>
											<li>    1. Identify assets</li>
											<li>    2. Create an architecture overview</li>
											<li>    3. Decompose the application</li>
											<li>    4. Identify the threats</li>
											<li>    5. Document the threats</li>
											<li>    6. Rate the threats</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 4: Security Standards, Frameworks and Disaster Recovery</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This week I especially found the discussion about CVSS scoring system (Spring et al., 2021) quite interesting. I think CVSS scoring system is a highly subjective one which can change according the the experience level and perception of each person, so it is pretty challenging to keep the consistency. Besides, as the authors point out, some organizations might have different priorities, therefore the standard equal weighting might not be useful for them. For example, for a cloud business, availability might be more important, whereas for a banking institution, the most important aspect might be integrity.</p>
								<p>The reading list, the seminar (which took place earlier to to tight schedule) and the optional activities prove very useful to develop a better understanding of the basic concepts of disaster recovery, available options, and the disaster recovery planning.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</b> defines the time to recover IT infrastructure in case of a disaster. </li>
									<li><b>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</b> defines the maximum amount of data that a business can afford to lose.</li>
									<li>An optimal <b>disaster recovery planning</b> should take (1) initial cost, (2) cost of data transfers, (3) cost of data storage, (4) software licensing fees, (5) organizations’s data needs, and (6) organization’s disaster recovery objectives.</li>
									<li>Geographical separation of primary and backup sites is an important concept in a DRP.</li>
									<li><b>Failover</b> is what happens when switched from the failed primary to secondary.</li>
									<li><b>Failback</b> is what happens when the switch is made back from secondary to primary.</li>
									<li><b>Access management in cloud</b> requires three capabilities: (1) Ability tı identify and authenticate users, (2) the ability to assign users access rights, and (3) the ability to create and enforce access control policies for resources.</li>
									<li>Initial root account provided by cloud service providers (CSP) shouldn’t be used for routine tasks as compromising this account can give root access to the attacker. <b><u>Best practice</u></b>: Use root account only for creating users and roles.</li>
									<li>MFA should be used to reduce the likelihood of credential compromise.</li>
									<li><u><b>Best practice</b></u>: <b>Bastion hosts</b> can be used to further secure the privileged user access to the operating systems an applications running in cloud. Bastion host determines which apps and systems a privileged user can access an what operations the privileged users can perform on these resources.</li>
									<li>If the encryption keys are managed by the customer (instead of default key management system -KMS- offered by the CSP), the keys should never be stored in the cloud.</li>
									<li>IT security framework is “a series of documented processes that define policies and procedures around the implementation and ongoing management of information security controls” (Kirvan & Granneman, 2021).</li>
								</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 5: Future Trends in Security and Risk Management</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>Security and Risk Management is a constantly evolving topic and as the organizations become more aware of the risks to their business and potential ways to mitigate them, novel ways to manage the risk emerge. This week’s reading list included many interesting articles about the future trends in the area of security and risk management such as Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), DevSecOps, and the application of Machine Learning (ML) to security management.</p>
								<p>This week I continued to work on the assignment 2 and I almost finished writing the code. Firstly, I coded the necessary functions as per the assignment requirements, then I applied a CLI script for an easier interaction with the user. The challenging part for me was to cover each possible failure scenario (e.g. invalid user input, invalid data, no .json file loaded, etc.) to make sure that the application fails safely. In the final week, I will work on the readme file as well as the executive summary itself.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul><b>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</b> is “the process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the activities of an organization to minimize the deleterious effects of risk on its capital and earnings” (Shackleford, 2021).</ul>
								<ul>Challenges that companies trying to implant ERM include misconceptions, implementation challenges, corporate governance, and external challenges.</ul>
								<ul>The best practices for successful implementation of ERM rely on conversations and prioritization. </ul>
								<ul>As a minimum, an <b>ERM policy</b> should include the general principles and define the accountabilities of key persons (such as CEO, CRO and the board). </ul>
								<ul><b>ERM framework</b> is the procedure manual for how ERM will be conducted and it can be based on an existing framework like ISO 31000 and can be customized to suit the organization.</ul>
								<ul>According to ISO, risk criteria is the terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated.</ul>
								<ul><b>DevSecOps</b> is the integration of security into DevOps.</ul>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h2>Unit 6: The Great Debate - What Will be the Most Influential Trend in ISM in the Next 5 Years?</h2>
								<h3>My reflections about the unit:</h3>
								<p>This unit was a short one with only one reading. The reading was related to the hard problems in the domain of security and it was interesting, but given that it was a powerpoint presentation it was not that informative but rather, thought-provoking. </p>
								<p>Therefore, I took my time to finish off my second and third assignments. I found out that the biggest challenge for me related to the Attack Tree Generator Application was to write unit tests. Because I developed the application in some unique way (for example, instead of passing variables to functions, using global variables or sometimes not returning anything because it was not necessary for the application), I had a hard time writing test cases. Then, I realized the true value of the Test Driven Development methodology. If I kept in mind to write testable code while I was developing the application, even if I did not completely applied the methodology, it would lead me to write a more elegant and testable code.</p>
								<p><center>--------</center> </p>
								<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The biggest challenge for <b>secure collaboration</b> is to develop methods to express and enforce policies and requirements for handling data among users from different authority domains and for different use cases.</li>
									<li><b>Predictive security metrics</b> may help assess a system to determine if the system in question preserves the security properties.</li>
									<li>In a <b>privilege graph</b>, nodes represent privilege states. An attacker starts at a node and tries to make his/her way to an attack goal by transitioning to new privilege states.</li>
									<li>The most important characteristics of <b>resilient architectures</b> is to deliver the required functionalities in the face of compromised components.</li>
								</ul>
