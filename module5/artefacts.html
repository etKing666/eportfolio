								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 (Initial Post): The Risks of Digitalisation (Unit 1):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Based on your reading of the case study listed above (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019) answer the following questions in the discussion forum:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’ - give two examples.</li>
										<li>Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.</li>
										<li>Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Here is my initial post:</p>
								<p>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) asserts that Industry 4.0 is a step forward from Industry 3.0 and relies on the novel ways of interaction between humans and machines and it corporates lates technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing or big data, among others. Without a doubt, cyber-physical systems play a central role in Industry 4.0. From my point of view, two most important examples of Industry 4.0 are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Smart factories</b> (Colicchia et al., 2017) in which tasks like production, maintenance and quality control are carried out in novel ways, introducing unprecedented levels of efficiency.</li>
									<li><b>Cloud computing</b> where the on-premises sources are outsourced to cloud service providers which provides businesses of different sizes a cost-effective (e.g., pay as you go model, lower cost of ownership, etc.) and more efficient (e.g., faster download times via CDNs, ability to scale up and out to meet increasing demand, etc.) ways to operate.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Two examples of risks that fit into the categories mentioned in the article:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Cloud computing brings many advantages to businesses along with new challenges. While the businesses used to have complete control over their (on-prem) infrastructure in the past, now they have to follow a shared responsibility model in which the responsibility to secure the infrastructure is shared between the service provider and the business itself. AWS Shared Responsibility Model (AWS, N.D.) is a fitting example for this one. So, this requires a new type of competence. In my opinion, this example fits into technical risks and competence risks.</li>
									<li>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a great solution for users who want to start using a software solution right away without having to worry about maintaining the software. However, it comes with a downside for some of the users: In the past, it was possible to buy the software once and for all. Now, the users have to subscribe to the software, and which is not always an ideal choice. Take Microsoft’s Office suite for example: Even though it is still possible to buy a version of the software, Microsoft 365 (Microsoft, N.D.) subscription model provides always up-to-date version with additional benefits like cloud storage service. However, due to their reluctancy to change their habits and having to pay an annual fee, some customers tend to shy away from using Microsoft 365 and stick with an outdated version of the office suite and without the additional perks like cloud storage. </li>
								</ul>
								<p>In their case study in which they studied the adoption of Industry 4.0 in Slovakia and Poland, Snieška et al. (2020) point out that level of awareness and perception of risks vary between the countries, but in general, Slovakia lags behind the many of the Western European countries due to negligence of Industry 4.0 for a long time, which affirms the competence and technical risks that are mentioned in the case study.</p>

								<h2>Seminar Preparation: Threat Modelling Exercises (Unit 2):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Read Shostack (2018) chapters 3 – 5 (that cover STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees and Attack libraries) and then create a threat model based on one of the following scenarios:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A large international airport based in the United States of America.</li>
									<li>A large international bank based in the UK.</li>
									<li>A large nuclear power station in France.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>You should use the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook and the ATT&CK libraries to inform your model design. Be prepared to share and discuss your designs at the seminar session this week.</p>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>I chose the "large international bank based in the UK" scenario for the exercise and started off by designing a simple data flow diagram:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/M5U2_Data_flow" alt="Data flow diagram for a large international bank" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">Data flow diagram for a large international bank<br /></p>
								<p>Even though this diagram is a rudimentary one and can be developed further, I think it consists of the basic components including the entities, data flows and the trust boundaries.</p>
								<p>Then, in the second step, I applied the STRIDE model to identify the potential threats to the bank:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/M5U2_STRIDE.png" alt="The application of STRIDE model to identify potential threats" height="400"><br /></p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">The application of STRIDE model to identify potential threats<br /></p>
								<p>I used MITRE ATT&CK libraries as well as my own knowledge and experience to populate the table. I had the opportunity to present my work in the seminar and the tutor advised be to incorporate the DREAD model as well and also to include mitigations to the threats identified. The feedback made perfect sense to me, and I intend to continue developing this model when I have the opportunity.</p>

								<h2>E-Portfolio Exercise: Security Standards (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b> Review the following standards and answer the questions below: GDPR, PSI DSS, HIPAA.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment? For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to GDPR. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards.</li>
									<li>Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how would you check if standards were being met?</li>
									<li>What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</li>
									<li>What assumptions have you made?</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>I reviewed the shared links about GDPR, PCI DSS and HIPAA and answered the questions for the current state and the digitalized business as well.</p>
								<p><b>Current state of business</b>: In my opinion, GDPR applies to the current state of business to some extent, as customers are able to correspond with the business and I assume that the business is sending emails to customers time to time, to inform them about the status of their orders or about the new products in stock. So, it is important to comply with the GDPR requirements about the customer consent and data retention. Since the company doesn’t accept online payments, PCI DSS does not apply to it. The company doesn’t operate in the health insurance industry, therefore, HIPAA is not applicable to it.</p>
								<p><b>Digitalised business</b>: Since the company is providing services to its online clientele, GDPR applies to it. The digitalised business also relies on a e-commerce website to offer its products and collects online payments, PCI DSS is applicable too. For the same reasons outlined above, HIPAA is not applicable to the business.</p>

								<h2>Assignment 1: Risk Identification Report (Unit 3):</h2>
								<h3>Overview: </h3>
								<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
								<p>Pampered Pets are a bricks-and-mortar business, based in a leafy suburb of Hashington-on-the-Water. It employs 4 staff; Alice the owner/ manager; Cathy the shop manager; Andrea the store assistant and Harry the warehouse manager. 90% of their business is carried out face to face, with people coming into the store to buy items. A small percentage of clients will email their orders – once these are ready the staff email the clients who then travel to the store to pick up goods and pay. Recently Harry has started to use an old, networked computer (with a spreadsheet package) to keep track of warehouse deliveries and item locations. The front desk uses a computer for all sales and purchases so that transactions are recorded digitally – this makes VAT and Tax submissions easier. The main shop has a wireless gateway and hub that both computers are connected to. In addition, all the staff use the wireless connection for various apps on their smart phones.</p>
								<p>The business is most famous for the quality of its pet foods – using the highest quality ingredients from local suppliers, with many items being prepared and packed in-house. This has a number of advantages including easy and regular quality checks of ingredients and a guaranteed supply chain – if necessary, employees could get into their cars and drive 10 minutes to the suppliers (mostly local farms) to pick up the ingredients by hand.</p>
								<p>Cathy, cognisant of the influence and benefits of the Internet, has retained the services of a consultancy (you) to research the best way to grow the business. The report should investigate all reasonable threats AND address the following three questions:
									<ul>
										<li>Could an online presence grow the business by up to 50%?</li>
										<li>Could changing to an international supply chain reduce costs by up to 24%?</li>
										<li>Could the business lose up to 33% of its existing customers if the business doesn’t provide some online features?</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Orla O’dour (eccentric Irish billionaire) decides to buy a share in the company and advises Cathy that the business should be digitalised to improve internal business processes and to expand the reach of the business internationally – and she is willing to fund the transformation.</p>
								<h3>My answer:</h3>
								<p>Even though there are other business-oriented approaches like PASTA, because they are too complicated and the business in question is a simple one, I chose to adopt a custom 5-step approach in which I analysed the business objectives, drew the data flow diagram of the business, analysed the threats using STRIDE and DREAD and in the end, came up with mitigations and recommendations. I used MITRE ATT&CK library to enumerate the threats and mitigations so that it is aligned with business standards and when needed, one can refer to the library for detailed information. I carried out a risk assessment of both the current state and the digitalised business and also came up with some recommended steps for the digitalisation process of the business.</p>
